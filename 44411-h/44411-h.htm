<h4>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">Lyman Beecher</span> was born in New Haven,
Conn., in 1775. He graduated from Yale
in 1797, and in 1798 took charge of the
Presbyterian Church at Easthampton,
Long Island. He first attracted attention
by his sermon on the death of Alexander
Hamilton, and in 1810 became pastor of
the Congregational Church at Litchfield,
Conn. In the course of a pastorate of
16 years, he preached a remarkable series
of sermons on temperance and became
recognized as one of the foremost pulpit
orators of the country. In 1826 he went
to Boston as pastor of the Hanover Street
Congregational Church. Six years later
he became president of the Lane Theological
Seminary in Ohio, an office he
retained for twenty years. In 1852 he
returned to Boston and subsequently retired
to the house of his son, Henry Ward
Beecher, where he died in 1863. His
public utterances, whether platform or
pulpit, were carefully elaborated. They
were delivered extemporaneously and
sparkled with wit, were convincing by their
logic, and conciliating by their shrewd
common sense.</p>

<h3>1775-1863</h3>

<h4>THE GOVERNMENT OF GOD DESIRABLE</h4>

<p><em>Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven</em>.&mdash;Matthew
vi., 10.</p>


<p>In this passage we are instructed to pray
that the world may be governed, and
not abandoned to the miseries of unrestrained
sin; that God Himself would govern,
and not another; and that God would administer
the government of the world, in all
respects, according to His own pleasure. The
passage is a formal surrender to God of power
and dominion over the earth, as entire as His
dominion is in His heaven. The petition,
therefore, "Thy will be done," contains the
doctrine:</p>

<p>That it is greatly to be desired that God
should govern the world, and dispose of men,
in all respects, entirely according to His own
pleasure.</p>

<p>The truth of this doctrine is so manifest,
that it would seem to rank itself in the number
of self-evident propositions, incapable of
proof clearer than its own light, had not experience
taught that, of all truths, it is the
most universally and bitterly controverted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Plain as it is, it has occasioned more argument
than any other doctrine, and, by argument
merely, has gained fewer proselytes;
for it is one of those controversies in which
the heart decides wholly, and argument,
strong or feeble, is alike ineffectual.</p>

<p>This consideration would present, on the
threshold, a hopeless impediment to further
progress, did we not know, also, that arguments
a thousand times repeated, and as often
resisted, may at length become mighty
through God, to the casting down of imaginations,
and every high thing that exalteth itself
against the knowledge of God. I shall,
therefore, suggest several considerations, to
confirm this most obvious truth, that it is desirable
that God should govern the world entirely
according to His own good pleasure.</p>

<p>1. It is desirable that God should govern
the world, and dispose of all events, according
to His pleasure, because He knows perfectly
in what manner it is best that the world
should be governed.</p>

<p>The best way of disposing of men and their
concerns is that which will effectually illustrate
the glory of God. The glory of God is His
benevolence, and His natural attributes for
the manifestation of it, and sun of the moral
universe, the light and life of His kingdom.
All the blessedness of the intelligent creation
arises, and ever will arise, from the manifestation
and apprehension of the glory of God.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
It was to manifest this glory that the worlds
were created. It was that there might be
creatures to behold and enjoy God, that His
dominions were peopled with intelligent
beings. And it is that His holy subjects may
see and enjoy Him, that He upholds and governs
the universe. The entire importance of
our world, therefore, and of men and their
concerns, is relative, and is great or small only
as we are made to illustrate the glory of God.
How this important end shall be most effectually
accomplished none but Himself is able to
determine. He, only, knows how so to order
things as that the existence of every being,
and every event, shall answer the purpose of
its creation, and from the rolling of a world
to the fall of a sparrow shall conspire to increase
the exhibitions of the divine character,
and expand the joy of the holy universe.</p>

<p>An inferior intelligence at the helm of government
might conceive very desirable purposes
of benevolence, and still be at a loss as
to the means most fit and effectual to accomplish
them. But, with God, there is no such
deficiency. In Him, the knowledge which discovered
the end discovers also, with unerring
wisdom, the most appropriate means to bring
it to pass. He is wise in heart; He hath established
the world by His wisdom and
stretched out the heavens by His discretion.
And is He not wise enough to be intrusted
with the government of the world? Who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
then, shall be His counsellor? Who shall supply
the deficiencies of His skill? Oh, the presumption
of vain man! and, oh! the depths
both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!</p>

<p>2. It is desirable that God should govern
the world according to His own pleasure, because
He is entirely able to execute His purposes.</p>

<p>A wise politician perceives, often, both the
end and the means; and is still unable to
bring to pass his counsels, because the means,
though wise, are beyond his control. But God
is as able to execute as He is to plan. Having
chosen the end, and selected the means, his
counsels stand. He is the Lord God omnipotent.
The whole universe is a storehouse of
means; and when He speaks every intelligence
and every atom flies to execute His
pleasure. The omnipotence of God, in giving
efficacy to His government, inspires and perpetuates
the ecstasy of heaven. "And a voice
came out from the throne, saying, Praise our
God. And I heard as it were the voice of a
great multitude, and as the voice of many
waters, and as the voice of many thunderings,
saying Alleluia, the Lord God omnipotent
reigneth." What will that man do in heaven,
who is afraid and reluctant to commit to God
the government of the earth? And what will
become of those who, unable to frustrate His
counsels, murmur and rebel against His providence?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>3. It is desirable that God should govern
the world according to His pleasure, because
the pleasure of God is always good.</p>

<p>The angels who kept not their first estate,
and many wicked men, have great knowledge,
and skill, and power: and yet, on these accounts,
are only the more terrible; because
they employ these mighty faculties to do evil.
And the government of God, were He a being
of malevolence, armed as He is with skill and
power, would justly fill the universe with dismay.
But, as it is, brethren, "let not your
hearts be troubled." With God there is no
perversion of attributes. He is as good as He
is wise and powerful. God is love! Love is
that glory of God which He has undertaken to
express to His intelligent creation in His
works. The sole object of the government of
God, from beginning to end, is, to express His
benevolence. His eternal decrees, of which so
many are afraid, are nothing but the plan
which God has devised to express His benevolence,
and to make His kingdom as vast and
as blest as His own infinite goodness desires.
It was to show His glory&mdash;to express, in action,
His benevolence&mdash;that He created all the
worlds that roll, and rejoice, and speak His
name, through the regions of space. It is to
accomplish the same blest design, that He upholds,
and places under law, every intelligent
being, and directs every event, causing every
movement, in every world, to fall in, in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
appointed time and place, and to unite in
promoting the grand result&mdash;the glory of God,
and the highest good of His kingdom. And is
there a mortal, who, from this great system
of blest government, would wish this earth
to be an exception? What sort of beings must
those be who are afraid of a government administered
by infinite benevolence, to express,
so far as it can be expressed, the infinite
goodness of God? I repeat the question,&mdash;What
kind of characters must those be who
feel as if they had good reason to fear a government
the sole object of which is to express
the immeasurable goodness of God?</p>

<p>4. It is greatly to be desired that God
should govern the world according to His
pleasure, because it is His pleasure to rule as
a moral governor.</p>

<p>A moral government is a government exercised
over free agents, accountable beings; a
government of laws, administered by motives.</p>

<p>The importance of such a government below
is manifest from the consideration, that it
is in His moral government, chiefly, that the
glory of God is displayed.</p>

<p>The superintendence of an empty world, or
a world of mere animals, would not exhibit,
at all, the moral character of God. The glory
of God, shining in His law, could never be
made manifest, and the brighter glory of God,
as displayed in the gospel, must remain forever
hid; and all that happiness of which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
are capable, as moral beings, the joys of religion
below, and the boundless joys of heaven
above, would be extinguished, in a moment,
by the suspension of the divine moral government.</p>

<p>Will any pretend that the Almighty cannot
maintain a moral government on earth, if
He governs according to His own pleasure?
Can He wield the elements, and control, at His
pleasure, every work of His hands, but just
the mind of man? Is the most noble work
of God&mdash;that which is the most worthy of
attention, and in reference to which all beside
is upheld and governed&mdash;itself wholly
unmanageable? Has Omnipotence formed
minds, which, the moment they are made, escape
from His hands, and defy the control of
their Maker? Has the Almighty erected a
moral kingdom which He cannot govern without
destroying its moral nature? Can He only
watch, and mend, and rectify, the lawless
wanderings of mind? Has He filled the earth
with untamed and untamable spirits, whose
wickedness and rebellion He can merely mitigate,
but cannot control? Does He superintend
a world of madmen, full of darkness and
disorder, cheered and blest by no internal
pervading government of His own? Are we
bound to submit to all events, as parts of the
holy providence of God; and yet, is there
actually no hand of God controlling the movements
of the moral world? But if the Almighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
can, and if he does, govern the earth
as a part of His moral kingdom, is there any
method of government more safe and wise
than that which pleases God? Can there be
a better government? We may safely pray,
then, "Thy will be done in earth as it is in
heaven," without fearing at all the loss of
moral agency; for all the glory of God, in His
Law and Gospel, and all the eternal manifestations
of glory to principalities and powers
in heavenly places, depend wholly upon the
fact, that men, though living under the government
of God, and controlled according to
His pleasure, are still entirely free, and accountable
for all the deeds done in the body.
There could be no justice in punishment and
no condescension, no wisdom, no mercy, in
the glorious gospel, did not the government
of God, though administered according to His
pleasure, include and insure the accountable
agency of man.</p>

<p>Seeing, therefore, that all the glory of God,
which He ever proposes to manifest to the
intelligent creation, is to be made known by
the Church, and is to shine in the face of Jesus
Christ, and is to depend upon the perfect consistency
of the moral government of God with
human freedom, we have boundless assurance
that, among His absolute, immutable, eternal
purposes, one, and a leading one, is, so to govern
the world according to His counsels, that,
if men sin, there shall be complete desert of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
punishment, and boundless mercy in their
redemption.</p>

<p>5. It is greatly to be desired that God
should rule in the earth according to His
pleasure, because it is His pleasure to govern
the world in mercy, by Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>The government is in the hand of a Mediator,
by whom God is reconciling the world to
Himself, not imputing their trespasses to them
that believe. Mercy is the bestowment of pardon
upon the sinful and undeserving. Now,
mankind are so eminently sinful, that no government
but one administered in infinite
mercy, could afford the least consolation.
Had any being but the God of mercy sat upon
the throne, or any will but His will prevailed,
there would have been no plan of redemption,
and no purposes of election, to perplex and
alarm the wicked. There would have been but
one decree, and that would have been, destruction
to the whole race of man. Are any reluctant
to be entirely in the hands of God? Are
they afraid to trust Him to dispose of soul and
body, for time and eternity? Let them surrender
their mercies, then, and go out naked
from that government which feeds, protects
and comforts them. Let them give up their
Bibles, and relinquish the means of grace, and
the hopes of glory, and descend and make
their bed in hell, where they have long since
deserved to be, and where they long since
would have been, if God had not governed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the world according to His own good pleasure.
If they would escape the evils which they fear
from the hand of God, let them abandon the
blessings they receive from it, and they will
soon discover whether the absolute dominion
of God, and their dependence upon Him, be,
in reality, a ground of murmuring and alarm.
Our only hope of heaven arises from being
entirely in the hands of God. Our destruction
could not be made more certain than it
would be were we to be given up to our own
disposal, or to the disposal of any being but
God. Would sinful mortals change their own
hearts? Could the combined universe, without
God, change the depraved affections of
men? Surely, then, we have cause for unceasing
joy, that we are in the hands of God;
seeing He is a God of mercy, and has decreed
to rule in mercy, and actually is administering
the government of the world in mercy, by
Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>We have nothing to fear, from the entire
dominion of God, which we should not have
cause equally to fear, as outcasts from the
divine government; but we have everything
to hope, while He rules the earth according to
His most merciful pleasure. The Lord reigneth;
let the earth rejoice, let the multitude of
the isles be glad. It is of the Lord's mercies
that we are not consumed, because His compassions
fail not.</p>

<p>6. It is greatly to be desired that God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
should dispose of mankind according to His
pleasure, because, if He does so, it is certain
that there will be no injustice done to anyone.</p>

<p>He will do no injustice to His holy kingdom
by any whom He saves. He will bring none
to heaven who are not holy, and prepared for
heaven. He will bring none there in any way
not consistent with His perfections, and the
best good of His kingdom; none in any way
but that prescribed in the gospel, the way of
faith in Jesus Christ, of repentance for sin,
and of good works as the constituted fruit and
evidence of faith.</p>

<p>Earthly monarchs have their favorites,
whom, if guilty of a violation of the laws, they
will often interpose to save, although the welfare
of the kingdom requires their punishment.
But God has no such favorites&mdash;He is
no respecter of persons: He spared not the
angels: and upon the earth distinctions of
intellect, or wealth, or honor, will have no
effect; he only that believeth shall be saved.
The great and the learned shall not be obtruded
upon heaven without holiness because
they are great or learned; and the humble and
contrite shall not be excluded because they are
poor, or ignorant, or obscure. God has provided
a way for all men to return to Him. He
has opened the door of their prison, and set
open before them a door of admission into the
kingdom of His dear Son; and commanded
and entreated them to abandon their dreary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
abode, and come into the glorious liberty of the
sons of God. But all, with one consent, refuse
to comply. Each prefers his own loathsome
dwelling to the building of God, and chooses,
stedfastly, the darkness of his own dungeon,
to the light of God's kingdom. But, as God
has determined that the redemption of His
Son shall not be unavailing through human
obstinacy, so He hath chosen, in Christ, multitudes
which no man can number, that they
should be holy and without blame before Him
in love. And in bringing these sons and
daughters to glory, through sanctification of
the Spirit, and belief of the truth, He will introduce
not one whom all the inhabitants of
heaven will not hail joyfully, as the companion
of their glory. And if God does in
the earth just as He pleases, He will make
willing, and obedient, and bring to heaven,
just those persons who it was most desirable
should come. And He will bring just as many
obstinate rebels to abandon their prison, and
enter cheerfully His kingdom, as infinite wisdom,
goodness, and mercy, see fit and desire.
He will not mar His glory, or the happiness
of His kingdom, by bringing in too many, nor
by omitting to bring in enough. His redeemed
kingdom, as to the number and the
persons who compose it, and the happiness
included in it, will be such as shall be wholly
satisfactory to God, and to every subject of
His kingdom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>And if God governs according to His pleasure,
He will do no injustice to His impenitent
enemies. He will send to misery no harmless
animals without souls&mdash;no mere machines&mdash;none
who have done, or even attempted to do,
as well as they could. He will leave to walk
in their own way none who do not deserve
to be left; and punish none for walking in it
who did not walk therein knowingly, deliberately
and with wilful obstinacy. He will give
up to death none who did not choose death,
and choose it with as entire freedom as Himself
chooses holiness; and who did not deserve
eternal punishment as truly as Himself deserves
eternal praise. He will send to hell
none who are not opposed to Him, and to
holiness, and to heaven; none who are not,
by voluntary sin and rebellion, unfitted for
heaven, and fitted for destruction, as eminently
as saints are prepared for glory. He
will consign to perdition no poor, feeble, inoffensive
beings, sacrificing one innocent
creature to increase the happiness of another.
He will cause the punishment of the wicked
to illustrate His glory, and thus indirectly to
promote the happiness of heaven. But God
will not illumine heaven with His glory, and
fill it with praise, by sacrificing helpless, unoffending
creatures to eternal torment; nor
will He doom to hell one whom He will not
convince also, that he deserves to go thither.
The justice of God, in the condemnation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the impenitent, will be as unquestionable, as
His infinite mercy will be in the salvation of
the redeemed.</p>

<p>If the will of God is done on earth, among
men, there will be no more injustice done to
the inhabitants of the earth than there is done
to the blessed in heaven. Was it ever known&mdash;did
any ever complain&mdash;was it ever conceived&mdash;that
God was a tyrant, in heaven?
Why, then, should we question the justice of
His government on earth? Is He not the same
God below as above? Are not all His attributes
equally employed? Does He not govern
for the same end, and will not His government
below conspire to promote the same joyful end
as His government above?</p>

<p>7. It is greatly to be desired that God
should govern the world according to His
pleasure, because His own infinite blessedness,
as well as the happiness of His kingdom, depends
upon His working all things according
to the counsel of His own will.</p>

<p>Could the Almighty be prevented from expressing
the benevolence of His nature, according
to His purposes, His present boundless
blessedness would become the pain of ungratified
desire. God is love, and His happiness
consists in the exercise and expression of it,
according to His own eternal purpose, which
He purposed in Christ Jesus before the world
began. It is therefore declared, "The Lord
hath made all things for himself;" that is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
to express and gratify His infinite benevolence.
The moral excellence of God does not
consist in quiescent love, but in love active,
bursting forth, and abounding. Nor does the
divine happiness arise from the contemplation
of idle perfections, but from perfections
which comprehend boundless capacity, and
activity in doing good.</p>

<p>From what has been said, we may be led to
contemplate with satisfaction the infinite
blessedness of God.</p>

<p>God is love! This is a disposition which,
beyond all others, is happy in its own nature.
He is perfect in love; there is, therefore, in
His happiness no alloy. His love is infinite;
and, of course, His blessedness is unbounded.
If the little holiness existing in good men,
though balanced by remaining sin, occasions,
at times, unutterable joy, how blessed must
God be, who is perfectly and infinitely holy!
It is to be remembered, also, that the benevolence
of God is at all times perfectly gratified.
The universe which God has created and
upholds, including what He has done, and what
He will yet do, will be brought into a condition
which will satisfy His infinite benevolence.
The great plan of government which God has
chosen, and which His power and wisdom will
execute, will embrace as much good as in the
nature of things is possible. He is not, like
erring man, straitened and perplexed, through
lack of knowledge or power. There is in His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
plan no defect, and in His execution no failure.
God, therefore, is infinitely happy in His
holiness, and in the expression of it which it
pleases Him to make.</p>

<p>The revolt of angels, the fall of man, and
the miseries of sin, do not, for a moment, interrupt
the blessedness of God. They were
not, to Him, unexpected events, starting up
suddenly while the watchman of Israel slumbered.
They were foreseen by God as clearly
as any other events of His government, and
have occasioned neither perplexity nor dismay.
With infinite complacency He beholds
still His unshaken counsels, and with almighty
hand rolls on His undisturbed decrees. Surrounded
by unnumbered millions, created by
His hand, and upheld by His power, He shines
forth, God over all, blest for ever. What an
object of joyful contemplation, then, is the
blessedness of God! It is infinite; His boundless
capacity is full. It is eternal; He is God
blest forever. The happiness of the created
universe is but a drop&mdash;a drop to the mighty
ocean of divine enjoyment. How delightful
the thought, that in God there is such an immensity
of joy, beyond the reach of vicissitude!
When we look around below, a melancholy
sensation pervades the mind. What
miserable creatures! What a wretched
world! But when, from this scene of darkness
and misery, we look up to the throne of God,
and behold Him, high above the darkness and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
miseries of sin, dwelling in light inaccessible
and full of glory, the prospect brightens. If
a few rebels, who refuse to love and participate
in His munificence, are groping in darkness
on His footstool, God is light, and in Him
there is no darkness at all.</p>

<p>Those who are opposed to the decrees of
God, and to His sovereignty, as displayed
in the salvation of sinners, are enemies of
God.</p>

<p>They are unwilling that His will should be
done in earth as it is in heaven; for the decrees
of God are nothing but His choice as to
the manner in which He will govern His own
kingdom. He did not enter upon His government
to learn wisdom by experience. Before
they were yet formed, His vast dominion lay
open to His view; and before He took the reins
of created empire, He saw in what manner it
became Him to govern. His ways are everlasting.
Known unto God are all His works
from the beginning. To be opposed to the
decrees of God, therefore, is to be unwilling
that God should have any choice concerning
the government of the world. And can those
be willing that God should govern the world
entirely according to His pleasure who object
to His having any pleasure upon the subject?
To object to the choice of God, with respect
to the management of the world, because it is
eternal, is to object to the existence of God.
A God of eternal knowledge, without an eternal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
will or choice, would be a God without
moral character.</p>

<p>To suppose that God did not know what
events would exist in His kingdom, is to divest
Him of omniscience. To suppose that He did
know, and did not care,&mdash;had no choice, no
purpose,&mdash;is to blot out His benevolence, to
nullify His wisdom and convert His power
into infinite indolence. To suppose that He did
know, and choose, and decree, and that events
do not accord with His purposes, is to suppose
that God has made a world which He can not
govern; has undertaken a work too vast; has
begun to build, but is not able to finish. But
to suppose that God did, from the beginning,
behold all things open and naked before Him,
and that He did choose, with unerring wisdom
and infinite goodness, how to govern His empire,&mdash;and
yet at the same time, to employ
heart, and head, and tongue, in continual
opposition to this great and blessed truth,&mdash;is,
most clearly, to cherish enmity to God and
His government.</p>

<p>To object to the choice of God because it is
immutable, is to cavil against that which constitutes
its consummating excellence. Caprice
is a most alarming feature in a bad government;
but in a government absolutely perfect,
none, surely, can object to its immutability,
but those, who, if able, would alter it for the
worse.</p>

<p>To say that, if God always knew how to govern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
so as to display His glory, and bless His
kingdom, and always chooses thus to govern,
there can be, therefore, no accountable agency
in the conduct of His creatures, is to deny the
possibility of a moral government, to contradict
the express testimony of God; and this,
too, at the expense of common sense, and the
actual experience of every subject of His
moral government on earth.</p>

<p>From the character of God, and the nature
of His government, as explained in this discourse,
may be inferred, the nature and necessity
of unconditional submission to God.</p>

<p>Unconditional submission is an entire surrender
of the soul to God, to be disposed of
according to His pleasure,&mdash;occasioned by
confidence in His character as God.</p>

<p>There are many who would trust the Almighty
to regulate the rolling of worlds, and
to rule in the armies of heaven, just as He
pleases; and devils they would consign to His
disposal, without the least hesitation; and
their own nation, if they were sure that God
would dispose of it according to their pleasure;
even their own temporal concerns they
would risk in the hands of God, could they
know that all things would work together for
their good; their souls, also, they would cheerfully
trust to His disposal, for the world to
come, if God would stipulate, at all events, to
make them happy.</p>

<p>And to what does all this amount? Truly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
that they care much about their own happiness,
and their own will, but nothing at all
about the will of God, and the welfare of His
kingdom. He may decree, and execute His
decrees, in heaven, and may turn its inhabitants
into machines, or uphold their freedom,
as He pleases; and apostate spirits are relinquished
to their doom, whether just or unjust.
It is only when the government of God descends
to particulars, and draws near and enters
their own selfish enclosures, and claims a
right to dispose of them, and extends its influence
to the unseen world, that selfishness
and fear take the alarm. Has God determined
how to dispose of my soul? Ah! that alters
the case. If He can, consistently with freedom,
govern angels, and devils, and nations,
how can He govern individuals? How can He
dispose of me according to His eternal purpose
and I be free? Here reason, all-penetrating,
and all-comprehensive, becomes weak; the
clouds begin to collect, and the understanding,
veiled by the darkness of the heart, can "find
no end, in wandering mazes lost."</p>

<p>But if God has purposes of mercy in reserve
for the sinner, he is convinced, at length, of
his sin, and finds himself in an evil case. He
reforms, prays, weeps, resolves, and re-resolves,
regardless of the righteousness of
Christ, and intent only to establish a righteousness
of his own. But, through all his
windings, sin cleaves to him, and the law, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
its fearful curse, pursues him. Whither shall
he flee? What shall he do? A rebel heart,
that will not bow, fills him with despair. An
angry God, who will not clear the guilty, fills
him with terror. His strength is gone, his
resources fail, his mouth is stopped. With
restless anxiety, or wild amazement, he surveys
the gloomy prospect. At length, amidst
the wanderings of despair, the character of
God meets his eye. It is new, it is amiable,
and full of glory. Forgetful of danger, he
turns aside to behold this great sight; and
while he gazes, new affections awake in his
soul, inspiring new confidence in God, and in
His holy government. Now God appears
qualified to govern, and now he is willing that
He should govern, and willing himself to be in
the hands of God, to be disposed of according
to His pleasure. What is the occasion of this
change? Has the divine character changed?
There is no variableness with God. Did he,
then, misapprehend the divine character?
Was all this glory visible before? Or has a
revelation of new truth been granted? There
has been no new revelation. The character
now admitted is the same which just before
appeared so gloomy and terrible. What, then,
has produced this alteration? Has a vision of
angels appeared, to announce that God is reconciled?
Has some sudden light burst upon
him, in token of forgiveness? Has Christ
been seen upon the cross, beckoning the sinner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
to come to Him? Has heaven been thrown
open to his admiring eyes? Have enrapturing
sounds of music stolen upon the ear, to entrance
the soul? Has some text of Scripture
been sent to whisper that his sins are forgiven,
tho no repentance, nor faith, nor love, has
dawned in his soul? And does he now submit,
because God has given him assurance of
personal safety? None of these. Considerations
of personal safety are, at the time, out
of the question. It is the uncreated, essential
excellence of God, shining in upon the heart,
which claims the attention, fixes the adoring
eye, and fills the soul with love, and peace,
and joy; and the act of submission is past,
before the subject begins to reflect upon his
altered views, with dawning hope of personal
redemption.</p>

<p>The change produced, then, is the effect of
benevolence, raising the affections of the soul
from the world, and resting them upon God.
Holiness is now most ardently loved. This is
seen to dwell in God and His kingdom, and to
be upheld and perfected by His moral government.
It is the treasure of the soul, and all
the attributes of God stand pledged to protect
it. The solicitude, therefore, is not
merely, What will become of me? but, What,
O Lord, will become of Thy glory, and the
glory of Thy kingdom? And in the character
of God, these inquiries are satisfactorily answered.
If God be glorified, and His kingdom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
upheld and made happy, the soul is satisfied.
There is nothing else to be anxious about;
for individual happiness is included in the
general good, as the drop is included in the
ocean.</p>

<h4>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">William Ellery Channing</span>, the famous
Unitarian divine, was born at Newport,
R. I., in 1780. He took his degree at
Harvard in 1798, studied theology and
was ordained pastor of the Federal Street
Church in Boston, 1803. He has been
called the Apostle of Unitarianism,
because he was first among the orthodox
divines of New England to give Unitarianism
a clear, dogmatic expression, as
he did in a sermon preached at the ordination
of Jared Sparks, in opposition to the
current Calvinism of the day. But he
hated the controversy in which the publication
of his views involved him and professed
in 1841, "I am little of a Unitarian
and stand aloof from all but those who
strive and pray for clearer light." He
had made the acquaintance of Wordsworth
and Coleridge on his visit to England,
and the latter justly described him as one
who had "the love of wisdom and the
wisdom of love." He was a voluminous
writer on theological and literary subjects
and what he wrote was vigorous, of
fastidious taste and fired with moral
earnestness. He died in 1842.</p>

<h2>CHANNING</h2>

<h3>1780-1842</h3>

<h4>THE CHARACTER OF CHRIST</h4>

<p><em>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased</em>.&mdash;Matthew
xvii., 5.</p>


<p>The character of Christ may be studied
for various purposes. It is singularly
fitted to call forth the heart, to awaken
love, admiration, and moral delight. As an
example it has no rival. As an evidence of
His religion perhaps it yields to no other
proof; perhaps no other has so often conquered
unbelief. It is chiefly to this last
view of it that I now ask your attention. The
character of Christ is a strong confirmation of
the truth of His religion. As such I would
now place it before you. I shall not, however,
think only of confirming your faith; the very
illustrations which I shall adduce for this
purpose will show the claims of Jesus to our
reverence, obedience, imitation, and fervent
love.</p>

<p>The more we contemplate Christ's character
as exhibited in the gospel, the more we shall
be impressed with its genuineness and reality.
It was plainly drawn from the life. The
narratives of the evangelists bear the marks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
of truth perhaps beyond all other histories.
They set before us the most extraordinary
being who ever appeared on earth, and yet
they are as artless as the stories of childhood.
The authors do not think of themselves. They
have plainly but one aim, to show us their
Master; and they manifest the deep veneration
which He inspired by leaving Him to
reveal Himself, by giving us His actions and
sayings without comment, explanation, or
eulogy.</p>

<p>You see in these narratives no varnishing,
no high coloring, no attempts to make His
actions striking or to bring out the beauties of
His character. We are never pointed to any
circumstance as illustrative of His greatness.
The evangelists write with a calm trust in His
character, with a feeling that it needed no
aid from their hands, and with a deep veneration,
as if comment or praise of their own
were not worthy to mingle with the recital
of such a life.</p>

<p>It is the effect of our familiarity with the
history of Jesus that we are not struck by it
as we ought to be. We read it before we are
capable of understanding its excellence. His
stupendous works become as familiar to us as
the events of ordinary life, and His high offices
seem as much matters of course as the common
relations which men bear to each other.</p>

<p>On this account it is fit for the ministers
of religion to do what the evangelists did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
attempt, to offer comments on Christ's character,
to bring out its features, to point men
to its higher beauties, to awaken their awe by
unfolding its wonderful majesty. Indeed, one
of our most important functions as teachers
is to give freshness and vividness to truths
which have become worn, I had almost said
tarnished, by long and familiar handling.
We have to fight with the power of habit.
Through habit men look on this glorious
creation with insensibility, and are less moved
by the all-enlightening sun than by a show of
fireworks. It is the duty of a moral and
religious teacher almost to create a new sense
in men, that they may learn in what a world
of beauty and magnificence they live. And
so in regard to Christ's character; men become
used to it until they imagine that there
is something more admirable in a great man
of their own day, a statesman or a conqueror,
than in Him the latchet of whose shoes statesmen
and conquerors are not worthy to unloose.</p>

<p>In this discourse I wish to show that the
character of Christ, taken as a whole, is one
which could not have entered the thoughts
of man, could not have been imagined or
feigned; that it bears every mark of genuineness
and truth; that it ought therefore
to be acknowledged as real and of divine
origin.</p>

<p>It is all-important, my friends, if we would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
feel the force of this argument, to transport
ourselves to the times when Jesus lived. We
are very apt to think that He was moving
about in such a city as this, or among a people
agreeing with ourselves in modes of thinking
and habits of life. But the truth is, he lived
in a state of society singularly remote from
our own.</p>

<p>Of all the nations the Jewish was the most
strongly marked. The Jew hardly felt himself
to belong to the human family. He was
accustomed to speak of himself as chosen by
God, holy, clean; whilst the Gentiles were
sinners, dogs, polluted, unclean. His common
dress, the phylactery on his brow or arm, the
hem of his garment, his food, the ordinary
circumstances of his life, as well as his temple,
his sacrifices, his ablutions, all held him up to
himself as a peculiar favorite of God, and all
separated him from the rest of the world.
With other nations he could not eat or marry.
They were unworthy of his communion. Still,
with all these notions of superiority he saw
himself conquered by those whom he despised.
He was obliged to wear the shackles of Rome,
to see Roman legions in his territory, a Roman
guard near his temple, and a Roman tax-gatherer
extorting, for the support of an
idolatrous government and an idolatrous worship,
what he regarded as due only to God.
The hatred which burned in the breast of the
Jew toward his foreign oppressor perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
never glowed with equal intenseness in any
other conquered state.</p>

<p>He had, however, his secret consolation.
The time was near, the prophetic age was at
hand, when Judea was to break her chains and
rise from the dust. Her long-promised king
and deliverer was near, and was coming to
wear the crown of universal empire. From
Jerusalem was to go forth His law, and all
nations were to serve the chosen people of
God. To this conqueror the Jews indeed
ascribed the office of promoting religion; but
the religion of Moses, corrupted into an outward
service, was to them the perfection of
human nature. They clung to its forms with
the whole energy of their souls. To the
Mosaic institution they ascribed their distinction
from all other nations. It lay at the
foundation of their hopes of dominion. I
believe no strength of prejudice ever equalled
the intense attachment of the Jew to his
peculiar national religion. You may judge of
its power by the fact of its having been transmitted
through so many ages, amidst persecution
and sufferings which would have subdued
any spirit but that of a Jew. You must bring
these things to your mind. You must place
yourselves in the midst of this singular
people.</p>

<p>Among this singular people, burning with
impatient expectation, appeared Jesus of
Nazareth. His first words were, "Repent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." These
words we hear with little emotion; but to the
Jews, who had been watching for this kingdom
for ages, and who were looking for its
immediate manifestation, they must have been
awakening as an earthquake. Accordingly we
find Jesus thronged by multitudes which no
building could contain. He repairs to a
mountain, as affording him advantages for
addressing the crowd. I see them surrounding
Him with eager looks, and ready to drink
in every word from His lips. And what do
I hear? Not one word of Judea, of Rome, of
freedom, of conquest, of the glories of God's
chosen people, and of the thronging of all
nations to the temple on Mount Zion.</p>

<p>Almost every word was a death-blow to the
hopes and feelings which glowed through the
whole people, and were consecrated under the
name of religion. He speaks of the long-expected
kingdom of heaven; but speaks of
it as a felicity promised to, and only to be
partaken of by, the humble and pure in heart.
The righteousness of the Pharisees, that which
was deemed the perfection of religion, and
which the new deliverer was expected to
spread far and wide, He pronounces worthless,
and declares the kingdom of heaven, or
of the Messiah, to be shut against all who do
not cultivate a new, spiritual, and disinterested
virtue.</p>

<p>Instead of war and victory He commands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
His impatient hearers to love, to forgive, to
bless their enemies; and holds forth this spirit
of benignity, mercy, peace, as the special badge
of the people of the true Messiah. Instead of
national interests and glories, he commands
them to seek first a spirit of impartial charity
and love, unconfined by the bounds of tribe or
nation, and proclaims this to be the happiness
and honor of the reign for which they hoped.
Instead of this world's riches, which they expected
to flow from all lands into their own,
He commands them to lay up treasures in
heaven, and directs them to an incorruptible,
immortal life, as the true end of their being.</p>

<p>Nor is this all. He does not merely offer
himself as a spiritual deliverer, as the
founder of a new empire of inward piety
and universal charity; He closes with
language announcing a more mysterious office.
"Many will say unto Me in that day, Lord,
Lord, have we not prophesied in Thy name,
and in Thy name done many wonderful
works? And then will I profess unto them, I
never knew you; depart from Me, ye that work
iniquity." Here I meet the annunciation of
a character as august as it must have been
startling. I hear Him foretelling a dominion
to be exercised in the future world. He begins
to announce, what entered largely into
His future teaching, that His power was not
bounded to this earth. These words I better
understand when I hear Him subsequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
declaring that, after a painful death, He was
to rise again and ascend to heaven, and there,
in a state of preeminent power and glory, was
to be the advocate and judge of the human
race.</p>

<p>Such are some of the views given by Jesus,
of His character and reign, in the Sermon on
the Mount. Immediately afterwards I hear
another lesson from Him, bringing out some
of these truths still more strongly. A Roman
centurion makes application to Him for the
cure of a servant whom he particularly
valued; and on expressing, in a strong manner,
his conviction of the power of Jesus to
heal at a distance, Jesus, according to the
historian, "marvelled, and said to those that
followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not
found so great faith in Israel; and I say unto
you, that many shall come from the east and
west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and
Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven;
but the children of the kingdom" (that is,
the Jews) "shall be cast out."</p>

<p>Here all the hopes which the Jews had cherished
of an exclusive or peculiar possession of
the Messiah's kingdom were crushed; and the
reception of the despised Gentile world to all
His blessings, or, in other words, the extension
of His pure religion to the ends of the earth,
began to be proclaimed.</p>

<p>Here I pause for the present, and I ask
you whether the character of Jesus be not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
most extraordinary in history, and wholly inexplicable
on human principles. Review the
ground over which we have gone. Recollect
that He was born and grew up a Jew in the
midst of Jews, a people burning with one
passion, and throwing their whole souls into
the expectation of a national and earthly deliverer.
He grew up among them in poverty,
seclusion, and labors fitted to contract His
thoughts, purposes, and hopes; and yet we
find Him escaping every influence of education
and society. We find Him as untouched
by the feelings which prevailed universally
around Him, which religion and patriotism
concurred to consecrate, which the mother
breathed into the ear of the child, and which
the teacher of the synagog strengthened in
the adult, as if He had been brought up in
another world. We find Him conceiving a
sublime purpose, such as had never dawned
on sage or hero, and see Him possessed with a
consciousness of sustaining a relation to God
and mankind, and of being invested with
powers in this world and the world to come,
such as had never entered the human mind.
Whence now, I ask, came the conception of
this character?</p>

<p>Will any say it had its origin in imposture;
that it was a fabrication of a deceiver? I
answer, the character claimed by Christ excludes
this supposition by its very nature. It
was so remote from all the ideas and anticipations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
of the times, so unfit to awaken sympathy,
so unattractive to the heathen, so exasperating
to the Jew, that it was the last to enter
the mind of an impostor. A deceiver of the
dullest vision must have foreseen that it would
expose him to bitter scorn, abhorrence, and
persecution, and that he would be left to carry
on his work alone, just as Jesus always stood
alone and could find not an individual to enter
into His spirit and design. What allurements
an unprincipled, self-seeking man could find
to such an enterprise, no common ingenuity
can discover.</p>

<p>I affirm next that the sublimity of the
character claimed by Christ forbids us to trace
it to imposture. That a selfish, designing,
depraved mind could have formed the idea
and purpose of a work unparalleled in beneficence,
in vastness, and in moral grandeur,
would certainly be a strange departure from
the laws of the human mind. I add, that if
an impostor could have lighted on the conception
of so sublime and wonderful a work as
that claimed by Jesus, he could not, I say,
he could not have thrown into his personation
of it the air of truth and reality. The part
would have been too high for him. He would
have overacted it or fallen short of it perpetually.
His true character would have rebelled
against his assumed one. We should
have seen something strained, forced, artificial,
awkward, showing that he was not in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
true sphere. To act up to a character so
singular and grand, and one for which no
precedent could be found, seems to me utterly
impossible for a man who had not the true
spirit of it, or who was only wearing it as a
mask.</p>

<p>Now, how stands the case with Jesus? Bred
a Jewish peasant or carpenter, He issues from
obscurity, and claims for Himself a divine
office, a superhuman dignity, such as had not
been imagined; and in no instance does He
fall below the character. The peasant, and
still more the Jew, wholly disappears.</p>

<p>We feel that a new being, of a new order
of mind, is taking a part in human affairs.
There is a native tone of grandeur and
authority in His teaching. He speaks as a
being related to the whole human race. His
mind never shrinks within the ordinary limits
of human agency. A narrower sphere than
the world never enters His thoughts. He
speaks in a natural, spontaneous style, of
accomplishing the most arduous and important
change in human affairs. This unlabored
manner of expressing great thoughts is particularly
worthy of attention. You never hear
from Jesus that swelling, pompous, ostentatious
language, which almost necessarily
springs from an attempt to sustain a character
above our powers. He talks of His glories as
one to whom they were familiar, and of His
intimacy and oneness with God as simply as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
a child speaks of his connection with his
parents. He speaks of saving and judging the
world, of drawing all men to Himself, and of
giving everlasting life, as we speak of the
ordinary powers which we exert. He makes
no set harangues about the grandeur of His
office and character. His consciousness of it
gives a hue to His whole language, breaks out
in indirect, undesigned expressions, showing
that it was the deepest and most familiar of
His convictions.</p>

<p>This argument is only to be understood by
reading the Gospels with a wakeful mind and
heart. It does not lie on their surface, and it
is the stronger for lying beneath it. When I
read these books with care, when I trace the
unaffected majesty which runs through the
life of Jesus, and see him never falling below
His sublime claims amidst poverty, and scorn,
and in His last agony, I have a feeling of the
reality of His character which I can not express.
I feel that the Jewish carpenter could
no more have conceived and sustained this
character under motives of imposture than an
infant's arm could repeat the deeds of
Hercules, or his unawakened intellect comprehend
and rival the matchless works of
genius.</p>

<p>Am I told that the claims of Jesus had
their origin not in imposture, but in enthusiasm;
that the imagination, kindled by strong
feeling, overpowered the judgment so far as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
give Him the notion of being destined to some
strange and unparalleled work? I know that
enthusiasm, or a kindled imagination, has
great power; and we are never to lose sight of
it, in judging of the claims of religious
teachers. But I say first, that, except in cases
where it amounts to insanity, enthusiasm
works, in a greater or less degree, according to
a man's previous conceptions and modes of
thought.</p>

<p>In Judea, where the minds of men were
burning with feverish expectation of a messiah,
I can easily conceive of a Jew imagining
that in himself this ardent conception, this
ideal of glory, was to be realized. I can
conceive of his seating himself in fancy on
the throne of David, and secretly pondering
the means of his appointed triumphs. But
that a Jew should fancy himself the Messiah,
and at the same time should strip that character
of all the attributes which had fired his
youthful imagination and heart&mdash;that he
should start aside from all the feelings and
hopes of his age, and should acquire a consciousness
of being destined to a wholly new
career, and one as unbounded as it was now&mdash;this
is exceedingly improbable; and one thing
is certain that an imagination so erratic, so
ungoverned, and able to generate the conviction
of being destined to work so immeasurably
disproportioned to the power of the
individual, must have partaken of insanity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, is it conceivable that an individual,
mastered by so wild and fervid an imagination,
should have sustained the dignity
claimed by Christ, should have acted worthily
the highest part ever assumed on earth?
Would not his enthusiasm have broken out
amidst the peculiar excitements of the life of
Jesus, and have left a touch of madness on his
teaching and conduct? Is it to such a man
that we should look for the inculcation of a
new and perfect form of virtue, and for the
exemplification of humanity in its fairest
form?</p>

<p>The charge of an extravagant, self-deluding
enthusiasm is the last to be fastened on Jesus.
Where can we find the traces of it in His
history? Do we detect them in the calm
authority of His precepts; in the mild, practical
and beneficial spirit of His religion; in the
unlabored simplicity of the language with
which He unfolds His high powers and the
sublime truths of religion; or in the good
sense, the knowledge of human nature, which
He always discovers in His estimate and treatment
of the different classes of men with
whom He acted? Do we discover this enthusiasm
in the singular fact that, whilst He
claimed power in the future world, and always
turned men's minds to Heaven, He never indulged
His own imagination or stimulated
that of His disciples by giving vivid pictures
or any minute description of that unseen
state?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>The truth is, that, remarkable as was the
character of Jesus, it was distinguished by
nothing more than by calmness and self-possession.
This trait pervades His other
excellences. How calm was His piety! Point
me, if you can, to one vehement, passionate
expression of His religious feelings. Does the
Lord's Prayer breathe a feverish enthusiasm?
The habitual style of Jesus on the subject of
religion, if introduced into many churches of
His followers at the present day, would be
charged with coldness. The calm and the
rational character of His piety is particularly
seen in the doctrine which He so earnestly
inculcates, that disinterested love and self-denying
service to our fellow creatures are the
most acceptable worship we can offer to our
Creator.</p>

<p>His benevolence, too, tho singularly
earnest and deep, was composed and serene.
He never lost the possession of Himself in His
sympathy with others; was never hurried into
the impatient and rash enterprises of an enthusiastic
philanthropy; but did good with the
tranquility and constancy which mark the
providence of God. The depth of this calmness
may best be understood by considering
the opposition made to His claims.</p>

<p>His labors were everywhere insidiously
watched and industriously thwarted by vindictive
foes who had even conspired to compass,
through His death, the ruin of His cause.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Now, a feverish enthusiasm which fancies
itself to be intrusted with a great work of
God is singularly liable to impatient indignation
under furious and malignant opposition.
Obstacles increase its vehemence; it becomes
more eager and hurried in the accomplishment
of its purposes, in proportion as they
are withstood.</p>

<p>Be it therefore remembered that the malignity
of Christ's foes, tho never surpassed, and
for the time triumphant, never robbed Him
of self-possession, roused no passion, and
threw no vehemence or precipitation into His
exertions. He did not disguise from Himself
or His followers the impression made on the
multitude by His adversaries. He distinctly
foresaw the violent death towards which He
was fast approaching. Yet, confiding in God
and in the silent progress of His truth, He
possest His soul in peace. Not only was
He calm, but His calmness rises into sublimity
when we consider the storms which raged
around Him and the vastness of the prospects
in which His spirit found repose. I say then
that serenity and self-possession were peculiarly
the attributes of Jesus. I affirm that the
singular and sublime character claimed by
Jesus can be traced neither to imposture nor
to an ungoverned, insane imagination. It can
only be accounted for by its truth, its reality.</p>

<p>I began with observing how our long familiarity
with Jesus blunts our minds to His singular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
excellence. We probably have often read
of the character which He claimed, without a
thought of its extraordinary nature. But I
know nothing so sublime. The plans and
labors of statesmen sink into the sports of children
when compared with the work which
Jesus announced, and to which He devoted
Himself in life and death with a thorough
consciousness of its reality.</p>

<p>The idea of changing the moral aspect of the
whole earth, of recovering all nations to the
pure and inward worship of one God and to
a spirit of divine and fraternal love, was one
of which we meet not a trace in philosopher
or legislator before Him. The human mind
had given no promise of this extent of view.
The conception of this enterprise, and the
calm, unshaken expectation of success in one
who had no station and no wealth, who cast
from Him the sword with abhorrence, and who
forbade His disciples to use any weapons but
those of love, discover a wonderful trust in the
power of God and the power of love; and when
to this we add that Jesus looked not only to
the triumph of His pure faith in the present
world, but to a mighty and beneficent power
in Heaven, we witness a vastness of purpose,
a grandeur of thought and feeling so original,
so superior to the workings of all other minds,
that nothing but our familiarity can prevent
our contemplation of it with wonder and profound
awe. * * *</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>Here is the most striking view of Jesus.
This combination of the spirit of humanity,
in its lowliest, tenderest form, with the consciousness
of unrivaled and divine glories, is
the most wonderful distinction of this wonderful
character. Here we learn the chief reason
why He chose poverty and refused every
peculiarity of manner and appearance. He
did this because He desired to come near to the
multitude of men, to make Himself accessible
to all, to pour out the fulness of His sympathy
upon all, to know and weep over their sorrows
and sins, and to manifest His interest in their
affections and joys.</p>

<p>I can offer but a few instances of this
sympathy of Christ with human nature in all
its varieties of character and condition. But
how beautiful are they! At the very opening
of His ministry we find Him present at a
marriage to which He and His disciples had
been called. Among the Jews this was an
occasion of peculiar exhilaration and festivity;
but Jesus did not therefore decline it.
He knew what affections, joys, sorrows, and
moral influences are bound up in this institution,
and He went to the celebration, not as an
ascetic, to frown on its bright hopes and warm
congratulations, but to sanction it by His
presence and to heighten its enjoyments.</p>

<p>How little does this comport with the solitary
dignity which we should have pronounced
most accordant with His character,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
and what a spirit of humanity does it breathe!
But this event stands almost alone in His
history. His chief sympathy was not with
them that rejoice, but with the ignorant, sinful,
sorrowful; and with these we find Him
cultivating an habitual intimacy. Tho so
exalted in thought and purpose, He chose uneducated
men to be His chief disciples; and
He lived with them, not as a superior, giving
occasional and formal instruction, but became
their companion traveled with them on foot,
slept in their dwellings, sat at their tables,
partook of their plain fare, communicated to
them His truth in the simplest form; and
tho they constantly misunderstood Him and
never perceived His full meaning, He was
never wearied with teaching them.</p>

<p>So familiar was His intercourse that we
find Peter reproving Him with an affectionate
zeal for announcing His approaching death,
and we find John leaning on His bosom. Of
His last discourse to these disciples I need
not speak. It stands alone among all writings
for the union of tenderness and majesty.
His own sorrows are forgotten in His solicitude
to speak peace and comfort to His humble
followers.</p>

<p>The depth of His human sympathies was
beautifully manifested when children were
brought Him. His disciples, judging as all
men would judge, thought that He was sent to
wear the crown of universal empire, had too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
great a work before Him to give His time and
attention to children, and reproved the parents
who brought them; but Jesus, rebuking
His disciples, called to Him the children.
Never, I believe, did childhood awaken such
deep love as at that moment. He took them in
His arms and blest them, and not only said
that "of such was the kingdom of heaven,"
but added, "He that receiveth a little child
in My name, receiveth Me;" so entirely did
He identify Himself with this primitive, innocent,
beautiful form of human nature.</p>

<p>There was no class of human beings so low
as to be beneath His sympathy. He not
merely taught the publican and sinner, but,
with all His consciousness of purity, sat down
and dined with them, and, when reproved by
the malignant Pharisee for such companionship,
answered by the touching parables of the
Lost Sheep and the Prodigal Son, and said,
"I am come to seek and to save that which
was lost."</p>

<p>No personal suffering dried up this fountain
of love in His breast. On His way to the cross
He heard some women of Jerusalem bewailing
Him, and at the sound, forgetting His own
grief, He turned to them and said, "Women
of Jerusalem, weep not for Me, but weep
for yourselves and your children." On the
cross, whilst His mind was divided between
intense suffering and the contemplation of the
infinite blessings in which His sufferings were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
to issue, His eye lighted on His mother and
John, and the sensibilities of a son and a
friend mingled with the sublime consciousness
of the universal Lord and Savior. Never
before did natural affection find so tender and
beautiful an utterance. To His mother He
said, directing her to John, "Behold thy son;
I leave My beloved disciple to take My place,
to perform My filial offices, and to enjoy a
share of that affection with which you have
followed Me through life;" and to John He
said, "Behold thy mother; I bequeath to you
the happiness of ministering to My dearest
earthly friend." Nor is this all. The spirit
of humanity had one higher triumph. Whilst
His enemies surrounded Him with a malignity
unsoftened by His last agonies, and, to give
the keenest edge to insult, reminded Him scoffingly
of the high character and office which He
had claimed, His only notice of them was the
prayer, "Father, forgive them, they know not
what they do."</p>

<p>Thus Jesus lived with men; with the consciousness
of unutterable majesty He joined
a lowliness, gentleness, humanity, and sympathy,
which have no example in human history.
I ask you to contemplate this wonderful union.
In proportion to the superiority of Jesus to
all around Him was the intimacy, the brotherly
love, with which He bound Himself to
them. I maintain that this is a character
wholly remote from human conception. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
imagine it to be the production of imposture
or enthusiasm shows a strange unsoundness
of mind. I contemplate it with a veneration
second only to the profound awe with which I
look up to God. It bears no mark of human
invention. It was real. It belonged to and it
manifested the beloved Son of God.</p>

<p>But I have not done. May I ask your
attention a few moments more? We have not
yet reached the depth of Christ's character.
We have not touched the great principle on
which His wonderful sympathy was founded,
and which endeared to Him His office of universal
Savior. Do you ask what this deep
principle was? I answer, it was His conviction
of the greatness of the human soul. He
saw in man the impress and image of the
Divinity, and therefore thirsted for his redemption,
and took the tenderest interest in
him, whatever might be the rank, character,
or condition in which he was found. This
spiritual view of man pervades and distinguishes
the teaching of Christ.</p>

<p>Jesus looked on men with an eye which
pierced beneath the material frame. The
body vanished before Him. The trappings
of the rich, the rags of the poor, were nothing
to Him. He looked through them, as tho
they did not exist, to the soul; and there,
amidst clouds of ignorance and plague-spots
of sin, He recognized a spiritual and immortal
nature, and the germs of power and perfection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
which might be unfolded forever. In the
most fallen and depraved man He saw a being
who might become an angel of light.</p>

<p>Still more, He felt that there was nothing
in Himself to which men might not ascend.
His own lofty consciousness did not sever
Him from the multitude; for He saw in His
own greatness the model of what men might
become. So deeply was He thus imprest that,
again and again, in speaking of His future
glories, He announced that in these His true
followers were to share. They were to sit on
His throne and partake of His beneficent
power.</p>

<p>Here I pause, and indeed I know not what
can be added to heighten the wonder, reverence,
and love which are due to Jesus. When
I consider Him, not only as possest with
the consciousness of an unexampled and unbounded
majesty, but as recognizing a kindred
nature in human beings, and living and dying
to raise them to a participation of His divine
glories; and when I see Him under these views
allying Himself to men by the tenderest ties,
embracing them with a spirit of humanity
which no insult, injury, or pain could for a
moment repel or overpower, I am filled with
wonder as well as reverence and love. I feel
that this character is not of human invention,
that it was not assumed through fraud, or
struck out by enthusiasm; for it is infinitely
above their reach. When I add this character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
of Jesus to the other evidences of His religion,
it gives to what before seemed so strange a new
and a vast accession of strength; I feel as if
I could not be deceived.</p>

<p>The Gospels must be true; they were drawn
from a living original; they were founded on
reality. The character of Jesus is not a fiction;
He was what He claimed to be, and what
His followers attested. Nor is this all. Jesus
not only was, He is still the Son of God, the
Savior of the world. He exists now; He has
entered that heaven to which He always looked
forward on earth. There He lives and reigns.
With a clear, calm faith I see Him in that
state of glory; and I confidently expect, at no
distant period, to see Him face to face. We
have indeed no absent friend whom we shall
so surely meet.</p>

<p>Let us then, my hearers, by imitation of His
virtues and obedience to His word, prepare
ourselves to join Him in those pure mansions
where He is surrounding Himself with the
good and pure of our race, and will communicate
to them forever His own spirit, power,
and joy.</p>

<h3>THE EXPULSIVE POWER OF A NEW
AFFECTION</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">&nbsp;</a></span></p>


<h4>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Thomas Chalmers</span>, theologian, preacher
and philanthropist, was born at Anstruther,
near St. Andrews, Scotland, in 1780.
In his thirty-fifth year he experienced a
profound religious change and became a
pronounced, tho independent, evangelical
preacher. On being appointed to the
Tron Church in Glasgow, he set about to
face what he called "the home heathenism."
During the week days he delivered his
series of "Astronomical Discourses," in
which he endeavored to bring science into
harmony with Christianity. His "Commercial
Discourses" were designed to
Christianize the principles of trade. But
he reduced pauperism chiefly by fighting
against intemperance in Glasgow. On
being transferred to St. John's Parish,
the largest, but poorest in the city, he
made Edward Irving his assistant. In
1828 he was called to the chair of theology
in Edinburgh University.</p>

<p>But it was as a preacher that he exerted
most influence by bringing the evangelical
message into relations with the science, the
culture, the thinking of his age. In doing
this he carried his hearers away by the
blazing force of his eloquence. Many
times in his preaching he was "in an
agony of earnestness," and one of his
hearers speaks of "that voice, that face,
those great, simple, living thoughts, those
floods of resistless eloquence, that piercing,
shattering voice!" He died in 1847.</p>

<h2>CHALMERS</h2>

<h3>1780-1847</h3>

<h4>THE EXPULSIVE POWER OF A NEW
AFFECTION</h4>

<p><em>Love not the world, neither the things that are in the
world. If any man love the world, the love of the
Father is not in him</em>.&mdash;1 John ii., 15.</p>


<p>There are two ways in which a practical
moralist may attempt to displace from
the human heart its love of the world;
either by a demonstration of the world's vanity,
so as that the heart shall be prevailed
upon simply to withdraw its regards from an
object that is not worthy of it; or, by setting
forth another object, even God, as more
worthy of its attachment; so as that the heart
shall be prevailed upon, not to resign an old
affection which shall have nothing to succeed
it, but to exchange an old affection for a new
one. My purpose is to show, that from the
constitution of our nature, the former method
is altogether incompetent and ineffectual&mdash;and
that the latter method will alone suffice
for the rescue and recovery of the heart from
the wrong affection that domineers over it.
After having accomplished this purpose, I
shall attempt a few practical observations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Love may be regarded in two different conditions.
The first is when its object is at a
distance, and when it becomes love in a state
of desire. The second is when its object is in
possession, and then it becomes love in a state
of indulgence. Under the impulse of desire,
man feels himself urged onward in some path
or pursuit of activity for its gratification.
The faculties of his mind are put into busy
exercise. In the steady direction of one great
and engrossing interest, his attention is recalled
from the many reveries into which it
might otherwise have wandered; and the powers
of his body are forced away from an indolence
in which it else might have languished;
and that time is crowded with
occupation, which but for some object of keen
and devoted ambition, might have driveled
along in successive hours of weariness and
distaste&mdash;and tho hope does not always enliven,
and success does not always crown
the career of exertion, yet in the midst of this
very variety, and with the alternations of occasional
disappointment, is the machinery of
the whole man kept in a sort of congenial play,
and upholden in that tone and temper which
are most agreeable to it; insomuch that, if
through the extirpation of that desire which
forms the originating principle of all this
movement, the machinery were to stop, and
to receive no impulse from another desire substituted
in its place, the man would be left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
with all his propensities to action in a state of
most painful and unnatural abandonment. A
sensitive being suffers, and is in violence, if,
after having thoroughly rested from his fatigue,
or been relieved from his pain, he continue
in possession of powers without any excitement
to these powers; if he possess a capacity
of desire without having an object of desire;
or if he have a spare energy upon his
person, without a counterpart, and without a
stimulus to call it into operation. The misery
of such a condition is often realized by him
who is retired from business, or who is retired
from law, or who is even retired from the occupations
of the chase, and of the gaming-table.
Such is the demand of our nature for
an object in pursuit, that no accumulation of
previous success can extinguish it&mdash;and thus
it is, that the most prosperous merchant, and
the most victorious general, and the most fortunate
gamester, when the labor of their respective
vocations has come to a close, are
often found to languish in the midst of all
their acquisitions, as if out of their kindred
and rejoicing element. It is quite in vain, with
such a constitutional appetite for employment
in man, to attempt cutting away from him
the spring or the principle of one employment,
without providing him with another. The
whole heart and habit will rise in resistance
against such an undertaking. The else unoccupied
female, who spends the hours of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
every evening at some play of hazard, knows
as well as you, that the pecuniary gain, or the
honorable triumph of a successful contest, are
altogether paltry. It is not such a demonstration
of vanity as this that will force her away
from her dear and delightful occupation. The
habit can not so be displaced as to leave nothing
but a negative and cheerless vacancy behind
it&mdash;tho it may be so supplanted as to
be followed up by another habit of employment,
to which the power of some new affection
has constrained her. It is willingly suspended,
for example, on any single evening,
should the time that is wont to be allotted to
gaming be required to be spent on the preparations
of an approaching assembly.</p>

<p>The ascendant power of a second affection
will do what no exposition, however forcible,
of the folly and worthlessness of the first, ever
could effectuate. And it is the same in the
great world. You never will be able to arrest
any of its leading pursuits by a naked demonstration
of their vanity. It is quite in vain
to think of stopping one of these pursuits in
any way else but by stimulating to another.
In attempting to bring a worthy man, intent
and busied with the prosecution of his objects,
to a dead stand, you have not merely to encounter
the charm which he annexes to these
objects, but you have to encounter the pleasure
which he feels in the very prosecution of
them. It is not enough, then, that you dissipate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the charm by your moral and eloquent
and affecting exposure of its illusiveness. You
must address to the eye of his mind another
object, with a charm powerful enough to dispossess
the first of its influence, and to engage
him in some other prosecution as full of interest
and hope and congenial activity as the
former. It is this which stamps an impotency
on all moral and pathetic declamation about
the insignificance of the world. A man will
no more consent to the misery of being without
an object, because that object is a trifle,
or of being without a pursuit, because that
pursuit terminates in some frivolous or fugitive
acquirement, than he will voluntarily submit
himself to the torture, because that torture
is to be of short duration. If to be without
desire and without exertion altogether is a
state of violence and discomfort, then the present
desire, with its correspondent train of exertion,
is not to be got rid of simply by destroying
it. It must be by substituting another
desire, and another line or habit of
exertion in its place, and the most effectual
way of withdrawing the mind from one object
is not by turning it away upon desolate
and unpeopled vacancy, but by presenting to
its regards another object still more alluring.</p>

<p>These remarks apply not merely to love considered
in its state of desire for an object not
yet obtained. They apply also to love considered
in its state of indulgence, or placid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
gratification, with an object already in possession.
It is seldom that any of our tastes
are made to disappear by a mere process of
natural extinction. At least, it is very seldom
that this is done through the instrumentality
of reasoning. It may be done by excessive
pampering, but it is almost never done by the
mere force of mental determination. But
what can not be thus destroyed, may be dispossest&mdash;and
one taste may be made to give
way to another, and to lose its power entirely
as the reigning affection of the mind. It is
thus that the boy ceases, at length, to be the
slave of his appetite; but it is because a manlier
taste has now brought it into subordination,
and that the youth ceases to idolize pleasure;
but it is because the idol of wealth has
become the stronger and gotten the ascendency,
and that even the love of money ceases
to have the mastery over the heart of many a
thriving citizen; but it is because, drawn into
the whirl of city politics, another affection has
been wrought into his moral system, and he
is now lorded over by the love of power.
There is not one of these transformations in
which the heart is left without an object. Its
desire for one particular object may be conquered;
but as to its desire for having some
one object or other, this is unconquerable. Its
adhesion to that on which it has fastened the
preference of its regards, can not willingly be
overcome by the rending away of a simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
separation. It can be done only by the application
of something else, to which it may
feel the adhesion of a still stronger and more
powerful preference. Such is the grasping
tendency of the human heart, that it must
have a something to lay hold of&mdash;and which,
if wrested away without the substitution of
another something in its place, would leave
a void and a vacancy as painful to the mind
as hunger is to the natural system. It may be
dispossest of one object, or of any, but it
can not be desolated of all. Let there be a
breathing and a sensitive heart, but without
a liking and without affinity to any of the
things that are around it, and in a state of
cheerless abandonment, it would be alive to
nothing but the burden of its own consciousness,
and feel it to be intolerable. It would
make no difference to its owner, whether he
dwelt in the midst of a gay and a goodly
world, or, placed afar beyond the outskirts of
creation, he dwelt a solitary unit in dark and
unpeopled nothingness. The heart must have
something to cling to&mdash;and never, by its own
voluntary consent, will it so denude itself of
all its attachments that there shall not be one
remaining object that can draw or solicit it.</p>

<p>The misery of a heart thus bereft of all
relish for that which is wont to minister enjoyment,
is strikingly exemplified in those who,
satiated with indulgence, have been so belabored,
as it were, with the variety and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
poignancy of the pleasurable sensations that
they have experienced, that they are at length
fatigued out of all capacity for sensation
whatever. The disease of ennui is more frequent
in the French metropolis, where amusement
is more exclusively the occupation of
higher classes, than it is in the British metropolis,
where the longings of the heart are more
diversified by the resources of business and
politics. There are the votaries of fashion,
who, in this way, have at length become the
victims of fashionable excess; in whom the
very multitude of their enjoyments has at last
extinguished their power of enjoyment; who,
with the gratifications of art and nature at
command, now look upon all that is around
them with an eye of tastelessness; who, plied
with the delights of sense and of splendor even
to weariness, and incapable of higher delights,
have come to the end of all their perfection,
and, like Solomon of old, found it to be vanity
and vexation. The man whose heart has thus
been turned into a desert can vouch for the
insupportable languor which must ensue,
when one affection is thus plucked away from
the bosom, without another to replace it. It
is not necessary that a man receive pain from
anything, in order to become miserable. It is
barely enough that he looks with distaste to
everything, and in that asylum which is the
repository of minds out of joint, and where
the organ of feeling as well as the organ of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
intellect has been impaired, it is not in the
cell of loud and frantic outcries where you
will meet with the acme of mental suffering;
but that is the individual who outpeers in
wretchedness all his fellows, who throughout
the whole expanse of nature and society meets
not an object that has at all the power to detain
or to interest him; who neither in earth
beneath, nor in heaven above, knows of a
single charm to which his heart can send forth
one desirous or responding movement; to
whom the world, in his eye a vast and empty
desolation, has left him nothing but his own
consciousness to feed upon, dead to all that is
without him, and alive to nothing but to the
load of his own torpid and useless existence.</p>

<p>We know not a more sweeping interdict
upon the affections of nature, than that which
is delivered by the apostle in the verse before
us. To bid a man into whom there is not yet
entered the great and ascendant influence of
the principle of regeneration, to bid him withdraw
his love from all the things that are in
the world, is to bid him give up all the affections
that are in his heart. The world is the
all of a natural man. He has not a taste, nor
a desire, that points not to a something placed
within the confines of its visible horizon. He
loves nothing above it, and he cares for nothing
beyond it; and to bid him love not the
world is to pass a sentence of expulsion on all
the inmates of his bosom. To estimate the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
magnitude and the difficulty of such a surrender,
let us only think that it were just as
arduous to prevail on him not to love wealth,
which is but one of the things in the world,
as to prevail on him to set wilful fire to his
own property. This he might do with sore
and painful reluctance, if he saw that the salvation
of his life hung upon it. But this he
would do willingly if he saw that a new property
of tenfold value was instantly to emerge
from the wreck of the old one. In this case
there is something more than the mere displacement
of an affection. There is the overbearing
of one affection by another. But to
desolate his heart of all love for the things
of the world without the substitution of any
love in its place, were to him a process of as
unnatural violence as to destroy all the things
he has in the world, and give him nothing in
their room. So if to love not the world be
indispensable to one's Christianity, then the
crucifixion of the old man is not too strong
a term to mark that transition in his history,
when all old things are done away, and all
things are become new.</p>

<p>The love of the world can not be expunged
by a mere demonstration of the world's worthlessness.
But may it not be supplanted by the
love of that which is more worthy than itself?
The heart can not be prevailed upon to part
with the world, by a simple act of resignation.
But may not the heart be prevailed upon to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
admit into its preference another, who shall
subordinate the world, and bring it down from
its wonted ascendency? If the throne which
is placed there must have an occupier, and
the tyrant that now reigns has occupied it
wrongfully, he may not leave a bosom which
would rather detain him than be left in desolation.
But may he not give way to the lawful
Sovereign, appearing with every charm
that can secure His willing admittance, and
taking unto Himself His great power to subdue
the moral nature of man, and to reign
over it? In a word, if the way to disengage
the heart from the positive love of one great
and ascendant object is to fasten it in positive
love to another, then it is not by exposing the
worthlessness of the former, but by addressing
to the mental eye the worth and excellence of
the latter, that all old things are to be done
away, and all things are to become new.</p>

<p>This, we trust, will explain the operation of
that charm which accompanies the effectual
preaching of the gospel. The love of God, and
the love of the world, are two affections, not
merely in a state of rivalship, but in a state
of enmity, and that so irreconcilable that they
can not dwell together in the same bosom. We
have already affirmed how impossible it were
for the heart, by any innate elasticity of its
own, to cast the world away from it, and thus
reduce itself to a wilderness. The heart is not
so constituted, and the only way to dispossess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
it of an old affection is by the expulsive power
of a new one. Nothing can exceed the magnitude
of the required change in a man's character&mdash;when
bidden, as he is in the New Testament,
to love not the world; no, nor any of
the things that are in the world&mdash;for this so
comprehends all that is dear to him in existence
as to be equivalent to a command of self-annihilation.
But the same revelation which
dictates so mighty an obedience places within
our reach as mighty an instrument of obedience.
It brings for admittance, to the very
door of our heart, an affection which, once
seated upon its throne, will either subordinate
every previous inmate, or bid it away. Beside
the world it places before the eye of the
mind Him who made the world, and with this
peculiarity, which is all its own&mdash;that in the
gospel do we so behold God as that we may
love God. It is there, and there only, where
God stands revealed as an object of confidence
to sinners&mdash;and where our desire after Him
is not chilled into apathy by that barrier of
human guilt which intercepts every approach
that is not made to Him through the appointed
Mediator. It is the bringing in of this
better hope, whereby we draw nigh unto God&mdash;and
to live without hope is to live without
God, and if the heart be without God the
world will then have all the ascendency. It
is God apprehended by the believer as God in
Christ who alone can dispost it from this ascendency.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
It is when He stands dismantled
of the terrors which belong to Him as an
offended lawgiver, and when we are enabled
by faith, which is His own gift, to see His
glory in the face of Jesus Christ, and to hear
His beseeching voice, as it protests good-will
to men, and entreats the return of all who will
to a full pardon, and a gracious acceptance&mdash;it
is then that a love paramount to the love
of the world, and at length expulsive of it,
first arises in the regenerating bosom. It is
when released from the spirit of bondage, with
which love can not dwell, and when admitted
into the number of God's children, through
the faith that is in Christ Jesus, the spirit of
adoption is poured upon us&mdash;it is then that
the heart, brought under the mastery of one
great and predominant affection, is delivered
from the tyranny of its former desires, and
in the only way in which deliverance is possible.
And that faith which is revealed to us
from heaven, as indispensable to a sinner's
justification in the sight of God, is also the
instrument of the greatest of all moral and
spiritual achievements on a nature dead to the
influence, and beyond the reach of every other
application.</p>

<p>Let us not cease then to ply the only instrument
of powerful and positive operation,
to do away from you the love of the world.
Let us try every legitimate method of finding
access to your hearts for the love of Him who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
is greater than the world. For this purpose
let us, if possible, clear away that shroud of
unbelief which so hides and darkens the face
of Deity. Let us insist on His claims to your
affection; and whether in the shape of gratitude,
or in the shape of esteem, let us never
cease to affirm that in the whole of that wondrous
economy, the purpose of which is to reclaim
a sinful world unto Himself, He, the
God of love, so sets Himself forth in characters
of endearment that naught but faith,
and naught but understanding are wanting,
on your part, to call forth the love of your
hearts back again.</p>

<p>And here let me advert to the incredulity
of a worldly man when he brings his own
sound and secular experience to bear upon the
high doctrines of Christianity, when he looks
on regeneration as a thing impossible, when,
feeling, as he does, the obstinacies of his own
heart on the side of things present, and casting
an intelligent eye, much exercised perhaps
in the observation of human life, on the equal
obstinacies of all who are around him, he pronounces
this whole matter about the crucifixion
of the old man, and the resurrection of
a new man in his place, to be in downright
opposition to all that is known and witnessed
of the real nature of humanity. We think
that we have seen such men, who, firmly
trenched in their own vigorous and home-bred
sagacity, and shrewdly regardful of all that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
passes before them through the week, and
upon the scenes of ordinary business, look on
that transition of the heart by which it gradually
dies unto time, and awakens in all the life
of a new-felt and ever-growing desire toward
God, as a mere Sabbath speculation; and who
thus, with all their attention engrossed upon
the concerns of earthliness, continue unmoved,
to the end of their days, among the feelings,
and the appetites, and the pursuits of earthliness.
If the thought of death, and another
state of being after it, comes across them at
all, it is not with a change so radical as that
of being born again that they ever connect the
idea of preparation. They have some vague
conception of its being quite enough that they
acquit themselves in some decent and tolerable
way of their relative obligations; and that,
upon the strength of some such social and domestic
moralities as are often realized by him
in whose heart the love of God has never entered,
they will be transplanted in safety from
this world, where God is the Being with whom,
it may almost be said that, they have had
nothing to do, to that world where God is the
Being with whom they will have mainly and
immediately to do throughout all eternity.
They will admit all that is said of the utter
vanity of time, when taken up with as a resting-place.
But they resist every application
made upon the heart of man, with the view
of so shifting its tendencies that it shall not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
henceforth find in the interests of time all its
rest and all its refreshment. They, in fact,
regard such an attempt as an enterprise that
is altogether aerial&mdash;and with a tone of secular
wisdom, caught from the familiarities of
every day of experience, do they see a visionary
character in all that is said of setting our
affections on the things that are above; and
of walking by faith; and of keeping our hearts
in such a love of God as shall shut out from
them the love of the world; and of having
no confidence in the flesh; and of so renouncing
earthly things as to have our conversation
in heaven.</p>

<p>Now, it is altogether worthy of being remarked
of those men who thus disrelish spiritual
Christianity, and, in fact, deem it an impracticable
acquirement, how much of a piece
their incredulity about the demands of Christianity,
and their incredulity about the doctrines
of Christianity, are with one another.
No wonder that they feel the work of the New
Testament to be beyond their strength, so long
as they hold the words of the New Testament
to be beneath their attention. Neither they
nor anyone else can dispossess the heart of an
old affection, but by the impulsive power of
a new one&mdash;and, if that new affection be the
love of God, neither they nor anyone else can
be made to entertain it, but on such a representation
of the Deity as shall draw the heart
of the sinner toward Him. Now it is just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
their belief which screens from the discernment
of their minds this representation. They
do not see the love of God in sending His
Son into the world. They do not see the expression
of His tenderness to men, in sparing
Him not, but giving Him up unto the death
for us all. They do not see the sufficiency of
the atonement, or of the sufferings that were
endured by Him who bore the burden that
sinners should have borne. They do not see
the blended holiness and compassion of the
Godhead, in that He passed by the transgressions
of His creatures, yet could not pass
them by without an expiation. It is a mystery
to them how a man should pass to the state
of godliness from a state of nature&mdash;but had
they only a believing view of God manifest in
the flesh, this would resolve for them the whole
mystery of godliness. As it is, they can not
get quit of their old affections, because they
are out of sight from all those truths which
have influence to raise a new one. They are
like the children of Israel in the land of
Egypt, when required to make bricks without
straw they cannot love God, while they want
the only food which can aliment this affection
in a sinner's bosom&mdash;and however great their
errors may be, both in resisting the demands
of the gospel as impracticable, and in rejecting
the doctrines of the gospel as inadmissible,
yet there is not a spiritual man (and it
is the prerogative of him who is spiritual to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
judge all men) who will not perceive that
there is a consistency in these errors.</p>

<p>But if there be a consistency in the errors,
in like manner, is there a consistency in the
truths which are opposite to them? The man
who believes in the peculiar doctrines will
readily bow to the peculiar demands of Christianity.
When he is told to love God supremely,
this may startle another, but it will
not startle him to whom God has been revealed
in peace, and in pardon, and in all the freeness
of an offered reconciliation. When told
to shut out the world from his heart, this may
be impossible with him who has nothing to
replace it&mdash;but not impossible with him who
has found in God a sure and satisfying portion.
When told to withdraw his affections
from the things that are beneath, this were
laying an order of self-extinction upon the
man, who knows not another quarter in the
whole sphere of his contemplation to which
he could transfer them, but it were not grievous
to him whose view had been opened to the
loveliness and glory of the things that are
above, and can there find, for every feeling of
his soul, a most ample and delighted occupation.
When told to look not to the things
that are seen and temporal, this were blotting
out the light of all that is visible from the
prospect of him in whose eye there is a wall
of partition between guilty nature and the
joys of eternity&mdash;but he who believes that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Christ has broken down this wall finds a gathering
radiance upon his soul, as he looks onward
in faith to the things that are unseen
and eternal. Tell a man to be holy&mdash;and how
can he compass such a performance, when his
fellowship with holiness is a fellowship of
despair? It is the atonement of the cross reconciling
the holiness of the lawgiver with the
safety of the offender, that hath opened the
way for a sanctifying influence into the sinner's
heart, and he can take a kindred impression
from the character of God now brought
nigh, and now at peace with him. Separate
the demand from the doctrine, and you have
either a system of righteousness that is impracticable,
or a barren orthodoxy. Bring
the demand and the doctrine together, and the
true disciple of Christ is able to do the one,
through the other strengthening him. The
motive is adequate to the movement; and the
bidden obedience to the gospel is not beyond
the measure of his strength, just because the
doctrine of the gospel is not beyond the measure
of his acceptance. The shield of faith,
and the hope of salvation, and the Word of
God, and the girdle of truth, these are the
armor that he has put on; and with these the
battle is won, and the eminence is reached,
and the man stands on the vantage ground
of a new field and a new prospect. The effect
is great, but the cause is equal to it, and stupendous
as this moral resurrection to the precepts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
of Christianity undoubtedly is, there is
an element of strength enough to give it being
and continuance in the principles of Christianity.</p>

<p>The object of the gospel is both to pacify
the sinner's conscience and to purify his
heart; and it is of importance to observe, that
what mars the one of these objects mars the
other also. The best way of casting out an
impure affection is to admit a pure one; and
by the love of what is good to expel the love
of what is evil. Thus it is, that the freer
gospel, the more sanctifying is the gospel;
and the more it is received as a doctrine of
grace, the more will it be felt as a doctrine
according to godliness. This is one of the secrets
of the Christian life, that the more a
man holds of God as a pensioner, the greater
is the payment of service that He renders back
again. On the venture of "Do this and live,"
a spirit of fearfulness is sure to enter; and
the jealousies of a legal bargain chase away
all confidence from the intercourse between
God and man; and the creature striving to
be square and even with his creator is, in fact,
pursuing all the while his own selfishness instead
of God's glory; and with all the conformities
which he labors to accomplish, the
soul of obedience is not there, the mind is not
subject to the law of God, nor indeed under
such an economy ever can be. It is only when,
as in the gospel, acceptance is bestowed as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
present, without money and without price,
that the security which man feels in God is
placed beyond the reach of disturbance, or
that he can repose in Him as one friend reposes
in another; or that any liberal and
generous understanding can be established betwixt
them, the one party rejoicing over the
other to do him good, the other finding that
the truest gladness of his heart lies in the impulse
of a gratitude by which it is awakened
to the charms of a new moral existence. Salvation
by grace&mdash;salvation by free grace&mdash;salvation
not of works, but according to the
mercy of God, salvation on such a footing is
not more indispensable to the deliverance of
our persons from the hand of justice than it
is to the deliverance of our hearts from the
chill and the weight of ungodliness. Retain
a single shred or fragment of legality with
the gospel, and you raise a topic of distrust
between man and God. You take away from
the power of the gospel to melt and to conciliate.
For this purpose the freer it is the
better it is. That very peculiarity which so
many dread as the germ of Antinomianism,
is, in fact, the germ of a new spirit and a new
inclination against it. Along with the lights
of a free gospel does there enter the love of
the gospel, which, in proportion as you impair
the freeness, you are sure to chase away. And
never does the sinner find within himself so
mighty a moral transformation as when, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
the belief that he is saved by grace, he feels
constrained thereby to offer his heart a devoted
thing, and to deny ungodliness.</p>

<p>To do any work in the best manner, you
would make use of the fittest tools for it. And
we trust that what has been said may serve
in some degree for the practical guidance of
those who would like to reach the great moral
achievement of our text, but feel that the tendencies
and desires of nature are too strong
for them. We know of no other way by which
to keep the love of the world out of our heart
than to keep in our hearts the love of God&mdash;and
no other way by which to keep our hearts
in the love of God, than by building ourselves
on our most holy faith. That denial of the
world which is not possible to him that dissents
from the gospel testimony, is possible,
even as all things are possible, to him that believeth.
To try this without faith is to work
without the right tool or the right instrument.
But faith worketh by love; and the
way of expelling from the heart the love that
transgresseth the law is to admit into its receptacles
the love which fulfilleth the law.</p>

<p>Conceive a man to be standing on the margin
of this green world, and that, when he
looked toward it, he saw abundance smiling
upon every field, and all the blessings
which earth can afford scattered in profusion
throughout every family, and the light of the
sun sweetly resting upon all the pleasant habitations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
and the joys of human companionship
brightening many a happy circle of society;
conceive this to be the general character of
the scene upon one side of his contemplation,
and that on the other, beyond the verge of the
goodly planet on which he was situated, he
could descry nothing but a dark and fathomless
unknown. Think you that he would bid
a voluntary adieu to all the brightness and
all the beauty that were before him upon
earth, and commit himself to the frightful
solitude away from it? Would he leave its
peopled dwelling places, and become a solitary
wanderer through the fields of nonentity? If
space offered him nothing but a wilderness,
would he for it abandon the home-bred scenes
of life and cheerfulness that lay so near, and
exerted such a power of urgency to detain
him? Would not he cling to the regions of
sense, and of life, and of society? Shrinking
away from the desolation that was beyond it,
would not he be glad to keep his firm footing
on the territory of this world, and to take
shelter under the silver canopy that was
stretched over it?</p>

<p>But if, during the time of his contemplation,
some happy island of the blest had
floated by, and there had burst upon his senses
the light of surpassing glories, and its sounds
of sweeter melody, and he clearly saw there
a purer beauty rested upon every field, and
a more heartfelt joy spread itself among all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
the families, and he could discern there a
peace, and a piety, and a benevolence which
put a moral gladness into every bosom, and
united the whole society in one rejoicing sympathy
with each other, and with the beneficent
Father of them all. Could he further see that
pain and mortality were there unknown, and
above all, that signals of welcome were hung
out, and an avenue of communication was
made before him&mdash;perceive you not that what
was before the wilderness, would become the
land of invitation, and that now the world
would be the wilderness? What unpeopled
space could not do, can be done by space
teeming with beatific scenes, and beatific society.
And let the existing tendencies of the
heart be what they may to the scene that is
near and visible around us, still if another
stood revealed to the prospect of man, either
through the channel of faith or through the
channel of his senses&mdash;then, without violence
done to the constitution of his moral nature,
may he die unto the present world, and live
to the lovelier world that stands in the distance
away from it.</p>

<h3>THE MISSIONARY CAUSE</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">&nbsp;</a></span></p>


<h4>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Alexander Campbell</span>, prominent in the
body known as Disciples or Christians,
was born in Ireland in 1788, and received
his education in Glasgow University. In
1809 he emigrated to the United States
and took charge of a Presbyterian congregation
in Bethany, Va. He did not
long remain in this pastorate, but proceeded
to institute a society based upon
the abolition of all confessions and formularies
and the acknowledgment of the
text of the Holy Scriptures as the sole
creed of the Church. In 1841 he founded
Bethany College (Bethany, Va.), and remained
its president until his death in
1866. In 1823 he founded the <cite>Christian
Baptist</cite>, changed its name in 1829 to the
<cite>Millennial Harbinger</cite>, but abandoned it
three years before his death. He was a
prolific controversial writer and published
over fifty volumes, among which were
hymn books and a translation of the New
Testament.</p>

<h2>CAMPBELL</h2>

<h3>1788-1866</h3>

<h4>THE MISSIONARY CAUSE<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></h4>

<p><em>He that winneth souls is wise.</em>&mdash;Prov. xi., 30.</p>


<p>The missionary cause is older than the
material universe. It was celebrated
by Job&mdash;the oldest poet on the pages
of time.</p>

<p>Jehovah challenges Job to answer Him a
few questions on the institutions of the universe.
"Gird up now thy loins," said He;
"and I will demand of thee a few responses.
Where wast thou when I laid the foundations
of the earth? Declare, if thou hast understanding.
Who has fixt the measure thereof?
Or who has stretched the line upon it? What
are the foundations thereof? Who has laid
the corner-stone thereof when the morning
stars sang together, and all the sons of God
shouted for joy? Who shut up the sea with
doors when it burst forth issuing from the
womb of eternity&mdash;when I made a cloud its
garment, and thick darkness its swaddling
band? I appointed its limits, saying, Thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
far shalt thou come, but no farther; and here
shall the pride of thy waves be stayed.</p>

<p>"Has the rain a father? Who has begotten
the drops of the dew? Who was the mother
of the ice? And the hoar-frost of heaven,
who has begotten it? Can mortal man bind
the bands of the Seven Stars, or loose the
cords of Orion? Can he bring forth and commission
the twelve signs of the Zodiac, or bind
Arcturus with his seven sons?</p>

<p>"Knowest thou, oh man, the missionaries of
the starry heavens? Canst thou lift up thy
voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters
may cover thee? Canst thou command the
lightnings, so that they may say to thee, Here
we are? Who can number the clouds in wisdom?
Or who can pour out the bottles of
heaven upon the thirsty fields?"</p>

<p>If such be a single page in the volume of
God's physical missionaries, what must be
its contents could we, by the telescope of an
angel, survey one single province of the universe,
of universes, which occupy topless, bottomless,
boundless space!</p>

<p>We have data in the Bible, and, in the
phenomena of the material universe, sufficient
to authorize the assumption that the missionary
idea circumscribes and permeates the entire
area of creations.</p>

<p>Need we inquire into the meaning of a
celestial title given to the tenantries of the
heaven of heavens? But you all, my Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
brethren, know it. You anticipate me.
The sweet poet of Israel told you long since,
in his sixty-eighth ode, that the chariots of
God are about twenty thousand of angels.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>And what is an angel but a messenger, a
missionary? Hence the seven angels of the
seven churches in Asia were seven missionaries,
or messengers, sent to John in his exile;
and by these John wrote letters to the seven
congregations in Asia.</p>

<p>Figuratively, God makes the winds and
lightnings his angels, his messengers of wrath
or of mercy, as the case may be.</p>

<p>But we are a missionary society&mdash;a society
assembled from all points of the compass, assembled,
too, we hope, in the true missionary
spirit, which is the spirit of Christianity in
its primordial conception. God Himself instituted
it. Moses is the oldest missionary
whose name is inscribed on the rolls of time.</p>

<p>He was the first divine missionary, and, if
we except John the Baptist, he was the second
in rank and character to the Lord Messiah
Himself.</p>

<p>Angels and missionaries are rudimentally
but two names for the same officers. But of
the incarnate Word, God's only begotten Son,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
He says, "Thou art my son, the beloved, in
whom I delight." And He commands the
world of humanity to hearken to Him. He
was, indeed, God's own special ambassador,
invested with all power in heaven and on earth&mdash;a
true, a real, an everlasting plenipotentiary,
having vested in Him all the rights of
God and all the rights of man. And were
not all the angels of heaven placed under
Him as His missionaries, sent forth to minister
to the heirs of salvation?</p>

<p>His commission, given to the twelve apostles,
is a splendid and glorious commission.
Its preamble is wholly unprecedented&mdash;"All
authority in heaven and on earth is given to
me." In pursuance thereof, he gave commission
to His apostles, saying, "Go, convert all
the nations, immersing them into the name
of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Spirit; teaching them to observe all
things whatever I have commanded you; and,
lo, I am with you always, even to the end of
the world." Angels, apostles and evangelists
were placed under this command, and by Him
commissioned as His ambassadors to the
world.</p>

<p>The missionary institution, we repeat, is
older than Adam&mdash;older than our earth. It
is coeval with the origin of angels.</p>

<p>Satan had been expelled from heaven before
Adam was created. His assault upon
our mother Eve, by an incarnation in the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
subtle animal in Paradise, is positive proof
of the intensity of his malignity to God and
to man. He, too, has his missionaries in the
whole area of humanity. Michael and his
angels, or missionaries, are, and long have
been, in conflict against the devil and his
missionaries. The battle, in this our planet,
is yet in progress, and therefore missionaries
are in perpetual demand. Hence the necessity
incumbent on us to carry on this warfare
as loyal subjects of the Hero of our redemption.</p>

<p>The Christian armory is well supplied with
all the weapons essential to the conflict. We
need them all. "We wrestle not against flesh
and blood, but against principalities, against
powers, against the rulers of the darkness of
this world, against wicked spirits in the regions
of the air." Hence the need of having
our "loins girded with the truth"; having
on the breastplate of righteousness, our
feet shod with the preparation to publish the
gospel of peace, taking the shield of faith, the
helmet of salvation and the sword of the
Spirit, the Word of God, always praying and
making supplication for our fellow-missionaries
and for all saints.</p>

<p>The missionary fields are numerous and various.
They are both domestic and foreign.
The harvest is great in both. The laborers
are still few, comparatively very few, in either
of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>The supply is not a tithe of the demand.
The Macedonians cry, "Come over and help
us;" "Send us an evangelist;" "Send us
missionaries;" "The fields are large, the people
are desirous, anxious, to hear the original
gospel. What can you do for us?" Nothing!
Nothing! My brethren, ought this so to be?</p>

<p>Schools for the prophets are wanting. But
there is a too general apathy or indifference
on the subject. We pray to the Lord of the
harvest to send our reapers to gather it into
His garner. But what do we besides praying
for it? Do we work for it? Suppose a
farmer should pray to the Lord for an abundant
harvest next year, and should never, in
seed-time, turn over one furrow or scatter one
handful of seed: what would we think of him?
Would not his neighbors regard him as a monomaniac
or a simpleton? And wherein does
he excel such a one in wisdom or in prudence
who prays to the Lord to send out reapers&mdash;missionaries,
or evangelists&mdash;to gather a harvest
of souls, when he himself never gives a
dollar to a missionary, or the value of it, to enable
him to go into the field? Can such a
person be in earnest, or have one sincere desire
in his heart to effect such an object or
purpose? We must confess that we could
have no faith either in his head or in his heart.</p>

<p>The heavenly missionaries require neither
gold nor silver, neither food nor raiment. Not
so the earthly missionaries. They themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
their wives and children, demand both food
and clothing, to say nothing of houses and
furniture. Their present home is not</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The gorgeous city, garnish'd like a bride,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Where Christ for spouse expected is to pass,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The walls of jasper compass'd on each side,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And streets all paved with gold, more bright than glass."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">If such were the missionary's home on earth,
he might, indeed, labor gratuitously all the
days of his life. In an humble cottage&mdash;rather
an unsightly cabin&mdash;we sometimes see
the wife of his youth, in garments quite as unsightly
as those of her children, impatiently
waiting "their sire's return, to climb to his
knees the envied kiss to share." But, when
the supper table is spread, what a beggarly
account of almost empty plates and dishes!
Whose soul would not sicken at such a sight?
I have twice, if not thrice, in days gone by,
when travelling on my early missionary tours&mdash;over
not the poorest lands nor the poorest
settlements, either&mdash;witnessed some such cases,
and heard of more.</p>

<p>I was then my own missionary, with the
consent, however, of one church. I desired
to mingle with all classes of religious society,
that I might personally and truthfully know,
not the theories, but the facts and the actualities,
of the Christian ministry and the so-called
Christian public. I spent a considerable portion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
of my time during the years 1812, '13,
'14, '15, '16, traveling throughout western
Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Ohio.</p>

<p>I then spent seven years in reviewing my
past studies, and in teaching the languages
and the sciences&mdash;after which I extended my
evangelical labors into other States and communities,
that I might still more satisfactorily
apprehend and appreciate the <em>status</em>, or the
actual condition, of the nominally and profest
religious or Christian world.</p>

<p>Having shortly after my baptism connected
myself with the Baptist people, and attending
their associations as often as I could, I became
more and more penetrated with the conviction
that theory had usurped the place of faith,
and that consequently, human institutions
had been, more or less, substituted for the
apostolic and the divine.</p>

<p>During this period of investigation I had
the pleasure of forming an intimate acquaintance
with sundry Baptist ministers, East
and West, as well as with the ministry of
other denominations. Flattering prospects of
usefulness on all sides began to expand before
me and to inspire me with the hope of
achieving a long-cherished object&mdash;doing some
good in the advocacy of the primitive and
apostolic gospel&mdash;having in the year 1820 a
discussion on the subject of the first positive
institution enacted by the Lord Messiah, and
in A. D. 1823 another on the same subject&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
former more especially on the subject and
action of Christian baptism, the latter more
emphatically on the design of that institution
tho including the former two.</p>

<p>These discussions, more or less, embraced
the rudimental elements of the Christian institution,
and gave to the public a bold relief
outline of the whole genius, spirit, letter and
doctrine of the gospel.</p>

<p>Its missionary spirit, tho not formally propounded,
was yet indicated, in these discussions;
because this institution was the terminus
of the missionary work. It was a component
element of the gospel, as clearly seen
in the commission of the enthroned Messiah.
Its preamble is the superlative fact of the
whole Bible. We regret, indeed, that this
most sublime preamble has been so much lost
sight of even by the present living generation.
If we ask when the Church of Jesus Christ began
or when the reign of the Heavens commenced,
the answer, in what is usually called
Christendom, will make it either to be contemporaneous
with the ministry of John the
Harbinger, or with the birth of the Lord
Jesus Christ. We will find one of these two
opinions almost universally entertained. The
Baptists are generally much attached to John
the Baptist; the Pedobaptists, to the commencement
of Christ's public ministry. John
the Baptist was the first Christian missionary
with a very considerable class of living Baptists;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the birth of Christ is the most popular
and orthodox theory at the respective meridians
of Lutheranism, Calvinism, and Arminianism.</p>

<p>But, by the more intelligent, the resurrection,
or the ascension of the Lord Jesus Christ,
is generally regarded as the definite commencement
of the Christian age or institution.</p>

<p>Give us Paul's or Peter's testimony, against
that of all theologians, living or dead. Let us
look at the facts.</p>

<p>Did not the Savior teach His personal
pupils, or disciples, to pray, "Thy kingdom"&mdash;more
truthfully, "Thy reign&mdash;come"? Does
any king's reign or kingdom commence with
his birth? Still less with his death? Did
not our Savior Himself, in person, decline the
honors of a worldly or temporal prince? Did
He not declare that His kingdom "is not of
this world"? Did He not say that He was
going hence, or leaving this world, to receive
or obtain a kingdom? And were not the
keys of the kingdom first given to Peter to
open, to announce it? And did he not, when
in Jerusalem, on the first Pentecost, after the
ascension of the Lord Jesus, make a public
proclamation, saying, "Let all the house of
Israel know assuredly that God has made (or
constituted) the identical Jesus of Nazareth,
the son of Mary, both the Lord and the Christ,
or the anointed Lord"?</p>

<p>Do kings reign before they are crowned?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Before they are anointed? There was not
a Christian Church on earth, or any man
called a Christian, until after the consecration
and coronation of Jesus of Nazareth as the
Christ of God.</p>

<p>The era of a son's birth was never, since
the world began, the era of his reign or of
the commencement of it. It is a strange fact,
to me a wonderful fact, and, considering the
age in which we live, an overwhelming fact,
that we, as a community, are the only people
on the checkered map of all Christendom,
Greek, Roman, Anglican or American, that
preach and teach that the commonly called
Christian era is not the era or the commencement
of the Christian Church or kingdom of
the Lord Jesus the Christ.</p>

<p>The kingdom of the Christ could not antedate
His coronation. Hence Peter, in announcing
His coronation, after His ascension,
proclaimed, saying, "Let all the house of
Israel know assuredly that God has made&mdash;<i lang="gr" xml:lang="gr">touton
ton Ieesoun</i>&mdash;the same, the identical
Jesus whom you have crucified, both Lord
and Christ"; or, in other words, has crowned
Him the legitimate Lord of all. Then indeed
His reign began. Then was verified the
oracle uttered by the royal bard of Israel,
"Jehovah said to my Jehovah"&mdash;or, "the
Lord said to my Lord,"&mdash;"Sit thou on my
right hand till I make thy foes thy footstool."</p>

<p>Hence He could say, and did say, to His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
apostles, "All authority in the heavens and
on the earth is given to me." In pursuance
thereof, "Go you into all the world, proclaim
the gospel to the whole creation; assuring
them that everyone who believes this proclamation
and is immersed into the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Spirit, shall be saved."</p>

<p>Here, then, the missionary field is declared
to be the whole world&mdash;the broad earth. They
were, as we are afterwards informed, to begin
at the first capital in the land of Judea, then
to proceed to Samaria, the capital of the ten
tribes, and thence to the last domicile of man
on earth.</p>

<p>There was, and there is still, in all this arrangement,
a gracious and a glorious propriety.</p>

<p>The Jews had murdered the Messiah under
the false charge of an impostor. Was it not,
then, divinely grand and supremely glorious
to make this awfully bloodstained capital the
beginning, the fountain, of the gospel age and
mission? Hence it was decreed that all the
earth should be the parish, and all the nations
and languages of earth the objects, and millions
of them the subjects, of the redeeming
grace and tender mercies of our Savior and
our God.</p>

<p>What an extended and still extending area
is the missionary field! There are the four
mighty realms of Pagandom, of Papaldom, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Mohammedandom and of ecclesiastic Sectariandom.
These are, one and all, essentially
and constitutionally, more or less, not of the
apostolic Christendom.</p>

<p>The divinely inspired constitution of the
Church contains only seven articles. These
are the seven hills, not of Rome, but of the
true Zion of Israel's God. Paul's summary
of them is found in the following words:
"One body, one spirit, one hope, one Lord,
one faith, one baptism, and one God and
Father of all."</p>

<p>The clear perception, the grateful reception,
the cordial entertainment of these seven
divinely constructed and instituted pillars,
are the alone sufficient, and the all-sufficient,
foundation&mdash;the indestructible basis&mdash;of
Christ's kingdom on this earth, and of man's
spiritual and eternal salvation in the full enjoyment
of himself, his Creator, his Redeemer,
and the whole universe of spiritual intelligence
through all the circles and the cycles
of an infinite, an everlasting future of being
and of blessedness.</p>

<p>The missionary spirit is, indeed, an emanation
of the whole Godhead. God the Father
sent His Son, His only begotten Son, into our
world. The Son sent the Holy Spirit to bear
witness through His twelve missionaries, the
consecrated and Heaven-inspired apostles.
They proclaimed the glad tidings of great joy
to all people&mdash;to the Jews, to the Samaritans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
to the Gentiles, of all nations, kindreds and
tongues. They gave in solemn charge to
others to sound out and proclaim the glad tidings
of great joy to all people. And need we
ask, is not the Christian Church itself, in its
own institution and constitution, virtually
and essentially a missionary institution?
Does not Paul formally state to the Thessalonians
in his first epistle that from them
sounded out the Word of the Lord not only
in Macedonia and in Achaia, but in every
place?</p>

<p>No man can really or truthfully enjoy the
spiritual, the soul-stirring, the heart-reviving
honors and felicities of the Christian institution
and kingdom, who does not intelligently,
cordially and efficiently espouse the missionary
cause.</p>

<p>In other words, he must feel, he must have
compassion for his fellow man; and, still further,
he must practically sympathize with him
in communicating to his spiritual necessities
as well as to his physical wants and infirmities.
The true ideal of all perfection&mdash;our
blest and blissful Redeemer&mdash;went about
continually doing good&mdash;to both the souls and
the bodies of his fellow men; healing all that
were, in body, soul or spirit, opprest by Satan,
the enemy of God and of man.</p>

<p>To follow his example is the grand climax
of humanity. It is not necessary to this end
that he should occupy the pulpit. There are,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
as we conceive, myriads of Christian men in
the private walks of life, who never aspired
to the "sacred desk," that will far outshine,
in eternal glory and blessedness, hosts of the
reverend, the boasted and the boastful right
reverend occupants of the sacred desks of this
our day and generation.</p>

<p>But Solomon has furnished our motto:&mdash;"He
that winneth" or taketh "souls is wise"
(Prov. xi. 30). Was he not the wisest of
men, the most potent and the richest of
kings, that ever lived? He had, therefore, all
the means and facilities of acquiring what we
call knowledge&mdash;the knowledge of men and
things; and, consequently, the value of men
and things was legitimately within the area
of his understanding; or, in this case, we
might prefer to say, with all propriety, within
the area of his comprehension.</p>

<p>Need I say that comprehension incomparably
transcends apprehension? Simpletons
may apprehend, but only wise men can comprehend
anything. Solomon's rare gift was,
that both his apprehension and his comprehension
transcended those of all other men,
and gave him a perspicacity and promptitude
of decision never before or since possest by
any man. His oracles, indeed, were the
oracles of God. But God especially gave to
him a power and opportunity of making one
grand experiment and development for the
benefit of his living contemporaries, and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
all posterity, to whom God presents his biography,
his Proverbs and his Ecclesiastes.</p>

<p>"The winning of souls" is, therefore, the
richest and best business, trade or calling, according
to Solomon, ever undertaken or prosecuted
by mortal man. Paul was fully aware
of this, and therefore had always in his eye a
"triple crown"&mdash;"a crown of righteousness,"
a "crown of life," a "crown of glory." And
even in this life he had "a crown of rejoicing,"
in prospect of an exceeding and eternal
weight of glory, imperishable in the heavens.</p>

<p>There is, too, a present reward, a present
pleasure, a present joy and peace which the
wisdom, and the riches, and the dignity, and
the glory, and the honors of this world never
did, never can, and consequently never will,
confer on its most devoted and persevering
votaries.</p>

<p>There is, indeed, a lawful and an honorable
covetousness, which any and every Christian,
man and woman, may cultivate and cherish.</p>

<p>Paul himself justifies the poetic license,
when he says, "Covet earnestly the best
gifts."</p>

<p>The best gifts in his horizon, however, were
those which, when duly cultivated and employed,
confer the greatest amount of profit
and felicity upon others. We should, indeed,
desire, even covet, the means and the opportunities
of beatifying and aggrandizing one
another with the true riches, the honors and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the dignities that appertain to the spiritual,
the heavenly and the eternal inheritance.</p>

<p>But we need not propound to your consideration
or inquiry the claims&mdash;the paramount,
the transcendent claims&mdash;which our enjoyment
of the gospel and its soul-cheering, soul-animating,
soul-enrapturing influences present
to us as arguments and motives to extend
and to animate its proclamation by every instrumentality
and means which we can legitimately
employ, to present it in all its attractions
and claims upon the understanding, the
conscience and the affections of our contemporaries,
in our own country and in all others,
as far as our most gracious and bountiful
Benefactor affords the means and the opportunities
of co-operating with Him, in the rescue
and recovery of our fellow men, who, without
such means and efforts, must forever
perish, as aliens and enemies, in heart and
in life, to God and to His divinely-commissioned
ambassador, the glorious Messiah.</p>

<p>We plead for the original apostolic gospel
and its positive institutions. If the great
apostles Peter and Paul&mdash;the former to the
Jews and the latter to the Gentiles&mdash;announced
the true gospel of the grace of God,
shall we hesitate a moment on the propriety
and the necessity, divinely imposed upon us,
of preaching the same gospel which they
preached, and in advocating the same institutions
which they established, under the plenary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
inspiration and direction of the Holy
Spirit? Can we improve upon their institutions
and enactments? What means that singular
imperative enunciated by the evangelical
prophet Isaiah (Isa. viii.), "Bind up the
testimony, seal the law among my disciples?"
What were its antecedents? Hearken! The
prophet had just foretold. He, the subject
of this oracle, viz: "The desire of all nations,"
was coming to be a sanctuary; but not a sanctuary
alone, but for a stone of stumbling and
a rock of offense (as at this day) to both the
houses of Israel&mdash;for a gin and for a snare to
the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The Church, therefore, of right is, and
ought to be, a great missionary society. Her
parish is the whole earth, from sea to sea, and
from the Euphrates to the last domicile of
man.</p>

<p>But the crowning and consummating argument
of the missionary cause has not been
fully presented. There is but one word, in
the languages of earth, that fully indicates it.
And that word indicates neither less nor more
than what is represented&mdash;literally, exactly,
perspicuously represented&mdash;by the word philanthropy.
But this being a Greek word
needs, perhaps in some cases, an exact definition.
And to make it memorable we will
preface it with the statement of the fact that
this word is found but twice in the Greek
original New Testament (Acts xxviii., 2, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Titus iii., 4.). In the first passage this word
is, in the common version, translated "kindness,"
and in the second, "love toward man."
Literally and exactly, it signifies the love of
man, objectively; but, more fully exprest, the
love of one to another.</p>

<p>The love of God to man is one form of philanthropy;
the love of angels to one man is
another form of philanthropy; and the love
of man to man, as such, is the true philanthropy
of the law. It is not the love of one
man to another man, because of favors received
from him; this is only gratitude. It
is not the love of one man to another man,
because of a common country: this is mere
patriotism. It is not the love of man to man,
because of a common ancestry: this is mere
natural affection. But it is the love of man
to man, merely because he is a man. This is
pure philanthropy. Such was the love of God
to man as exhibited in the gift of His dearly
beloved Son as a sin-offering for him. This is
the name which the inspired writers of the
New Testament give it. So Paul uses it, Titus
iii. and iv. It should have been translated,
"After that the kindness and philanthropy of
God our Savior appeared." Again, Acts
xxviii., 2, "The barbarous people of the Island
of Melita showed us no little philanthropy.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
They kindled a fire for us on their island,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
because of the impending rain and the
cold."</p>

<p>There are, indeed, many forms and demonstrations
of philanthropy. For one good man
another good man might presume to die. But
the philanthropy of God to man incomparably
transcends all other forms of philanthropy
known on earth or reported from heaven.</p>

<p>While we were sinners, in positive and actual
rebellion against our Father and our
God, He freely gave up His only begotten and
dearly beloved Son, as a sin-offering for us,
and laid upon Him, or placed in His account,
the sin, the aggregate sin, of the world. He
became in the hand of His Father and our
Father a sin-offering for us. He took upon
Himself, and His Father "laid upon him, the
iniquity of us all." Was ever love like this?
Angels of all ranks, spirits of all capacities,
still contemplate it with increasing wonder
and delight.</p>

<p>This gospel message is to be announced to
all the world, to men of every nation under
heaven. And this, too, with the promise of
the forgiveness of sins and of a life everlasting
in the heavens, to everyone who will cordially
accept and obey it.</p>

<h4>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward Irving</span> was born at Annan,
Dumfriesshire, Scotland, in 1792. He was
an early friend and lover of Jane Welsh,
who afterwards married Thomas Carlyle.
He showed ability at school, but had also
a taste for the preaching of extreme
Presbyterian seceders from the Church
of Scotland. After graduating at the
University of Edinburgh, in 1809, he
began life by teaching school, but obtained
a license to preach in 1815. He became
assistant to Chalmers at Glasgow in 1819,
where, great preacher as he was, he felt
himself eclipsed by Chalmers, and in 1822
accepted the pulpit at a chapel in Hatton
Garden, London. Here he leapt into
fame. His melodious and resonant voice,
his noble presence and the beauty of his
features, enhanced the eloquence of his
language. Eventually he became unbalanced
by the adulation of the aristocratic
and intellectual crowd that listened
to him. They, however, grew tired of his
prophecies and denunciations, and his eccentricities
of judgment finally led to
disruption, and "after a few years of
futile but splendid evangelization, he died
a broken-hearted man, tender and true
to the last, altho the victim of unsubstantial
religious vagaries." Carlyle
wrote a touching memoir of his life. He
died in 1834.</p>

<h4>PREPARATION FOR CONSULTING THE
ORACLES OF GOD</h4>

<p><em>Search the scriptures.</em>&mdash;John v., 39.</p>


<p>There was a time when each revelation
of the word of God had an introduction
into this earth, which neither
permitted men to doubt whence it came,
nor wherefore it was sent. If at the
giving of each several truth a star was
not lighted up in heaven, as at the birth
of the Prince of Truth, there was done upon
the earth a wonder, to make her children
listen to the message of their Maker. The
Almighty made bare His arm; and, through
mighty acts shown by His holy servants, gave
demonstration of His truth, and found for it a
sure place among the other matters of human
knowledge and belief.</p>

<p>But now the miracles of God have ceased,
and nature, secure and unmolested, is no
longer called on for testimonies to her Creator's
voice. No burning bush draws the footsteps
to His presence chamber; no invisible
voice holds the ear awake; no hand cometh
forth from the obscurity to write His purposes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
in letters of flame. The vision is shut up, and
the testimony is sealed, and the Word of the
Lord is ended, and this solitary volume, with
its chapters and verses, is the sum total of all
for which the chariot of heaven made so many
visits to the earth, and the Son of God Himself
tabernacled and dwelt among us.</p>

<p>The truth which it contains once dwelt undivulged
in the bosom of God; and, on coming
forth to take its place among things revealed,
the heavens and the earth, and nature,
through all her chambers, gave reverent welcome.
Beyond what it contains, the mysteries
of the future are unknown. To gain it acceptation
and currency, the noble company of
martyrs testified unto the death. The general
assembly of the first-born in heaven made it
the day-star of their hopes, and the pavilion
of their peace. Its every sentence is charmed
with the power of God, and powerful to the
everlasting salvation of souls.</p>

<p>Having our minds filled with these thoughts
of the primeval divinity of revealed wisdom
when she dwelt in the bosom of God, and was
of His eternal Self a part, long before He prepared
the heavens, or set a compass upon the
face of the deep; revolving also how, by the
space of four thousand years, every faculty
of mute nature did solemn obeisance to this
daughter of the Divine mind, whenever He
pleased to commission her forth to the help of
mortals; and further meditating upon the delights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
which she had of old with the sons of
men, the height of heavenly temper to which
she raised them, and the offspring of magnanimous
deeds which these two&mdash;the wisdom of
God, and the soul of man&mdash;did engender between
themselves&mdash;meditating, I say, upon
these mighty topics, our soul is smitten with
grief and shame to remark how in this latter
day she hath fallen from her high estate;
and fallen along with her the great and noble
character of men. Or, if there be still a few
names, as of the missionary martyr, to emulate
the saints of old&mdash;how to the commonalty
of Christians her oracles have fallen into a
household commonness, and her visits into a
cheap familiarity; while by the multitude she
is mistaken for a minister of terror sent to
oppress poor mortals with moping melancholy,
and inflict a wound upon the happiness
of human kind.</p>

<p>For there is now no express stirring up the
faculties to meditate her high and heavenly
strains&mdash;there is no formal sequestration of
the mind from all other concerns, on purpose
for her special entertainment&mdash;there is no
house of solemn seeking and solemn waiting
for a spiritual frame, before entering and
listening to the voice of the Almighty's wisdom.
Who feels the sublime dignity there is
in a saying, fresh descended from the porch
of heaven? Who feels the awful weight there
is in the least iota that hath dropped from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
the lips of God? Who feels the thrilling fear
or trembling hope there is in words whereon
the destinies of himself do hang? Who feels
the swelling tide of gratitude within his
breast, for redemption and salvation, instead
of flat despair and everlasting retribution?
Yea, that which is the guide and spur of all
duty, the necessary aliment of Christian life,
the first and the last of Christian knowledge
and Christian feeling, hath, to speak the best,
degenerated in these days to stand, rank and
file, among those duties whereof it is parent,
preserver, and commander. And, to speak not
the best, but the fair and common truth, this
book, the offspring of the Divine mind, and
the perfection of heavenly wisdom, is permitted
to lie from day to day, perhaps from week
to week, unheeded and unperused, never welcome
to our happy, healthy, and energetic
moods; admitted, if admitted at all, in seasons
of sickness, feeble-mindedness, and disabling
sorrow. Yes, that which was sent to be a
spirit of ceaseless joy and hope within the
heart of man, is treated as the enemy of
happiness, and the murderer of enjoyment;
and eyed askance, as the remembrancer of
death, and the very messenger of hell.</p>

<p>Oh! if books had but tongues to speak their
wrongs, then might this book well exclaim:
Hear, O heavens! and give ear, O earth! I
came from the love and embrace of God, and
mute nature, to whom I brought no boon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
did me rightful homage. To men I come, and
my words were to the children of men. I
disclosed to you the mysteries hereafter, and
the secrets of the throne of God. I set open
to you the gates of salvation, and the way of
eternal life, hitherto unknown. Nothing in
heaven did I withhold from your hope and
ambition; and upon your earthly lot I poured
the full horn of Divine providence and consolation.
But ye requited me with no welcome,
ye held no festivity on my arrival; ye sequester
me from happiness and heroism, closeting
me with sickness and infirmity: ye make not
of me, nor use me for, your guide to wisdom
and prudence, but put me into a place in your
last of duties, and withdraw me to a mere corner
of your time; and most of ye set me at
naught and utterly disregard me. I come, the
fulness of the knowledge of God; angels delighted
in my company, and desired to dive
into my secrets. But ye, mortals, place masters
over me, subjecting me to the discipline and
dogmatism of men, and tutoring me in your
schools of learning. I came, not to be silent in
your dwellings, but to speak welfare to you
and to your children. I came to rule, and my
throne to set up in the hearts of men. Mine
ancient residence was the bosom of God; no
residence will I have but the soul of an immortal;
and if you had entertained me, I
should have possest you of the peace which
I had with God, "when I was with Him and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
was daily His delight, rejoicing always before
Him. Because I have called you and
ye have refused, I have stretched out my hand
and no man regarded; but ye have set at
naught all my counsel and would none of my
reproof; I also will laugh at your calamity,
and mock when your fear cometh as desolation,
and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind,
when distress and anguish cometh upon
you. Then shall they cry upon me, but I will
not answer; they shall seek me early, but they
shall not find me."</p>

<p>From this cheap estimation and wanton
neglect of God's counsel, and from the terror
of the curse consequent thereon, we have
resolved, in the strength of God, to do our
endeavor to deliver this congregation of His
intelligent and worshiping people&mdash;an endeavor
which we make with a full perception
of the difficulties to be overcome on every side,
within no less than without the sacred pale;
and upon which we enter with the utmost
diffidence of our powers, yet with the full
purpose of straining them to the utmost, according
to the measure with which it hath
pleased God to endow our mind. And do
Thou, O Lord, from whom cometh the perception
of truth, vouchsafe to Thy servant an
unction from Thine own Spirit, who searcheth
all things, yes, the deep things of God;
and vouchsafe to Thy people "the hearing ear
and the understanding heart, that they may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
hear and understand, and their souls may
live!"</p>

<p>Before the Almighty made His appearance
upon Sinai, there were awful precursors sent
to prepare His way; while He abode in sight,
there were solemn ceremonies and a strict
ritual of attendance; when He departed, the
whole camp set itself to conform unto His
revealed will. Likewise, before the Savior
appeared, with His better law, there was a
noble procession of seers and prophets, who
decried and warned the world of His coming;
when He came there were solemn announcements
in the heavens and on the earth; He did
not depart without due honors; and then
followed, on His departure, a succession of
changes and alterations which are still in
progress, and shall continue in progress till
the world's end. This may serve to teach us,
that a revelation of the Almighty's will makes
demand for these three things, on the part of
those to whom it is revealed: A due preparation
for receiving it; a diligent attention to it
while it is disclosing; a strict observance of it
when it is delivered.</p>

<p>In the whole book of the Lord's revelations
you shall search in vain for one which is devoid
of these necessary parts. Witness the
awestruck Isaiah, while the Lord displayed
before him the sublime pomp of His presence;
and, not content with overpowering the frail
sense of the prophet, dispatched a seraph to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
do the ceremonial of touching his lip with
hallowed fire, all before He uttered one word
into his astonished ear. Witness the majestic
apparition to Saint John, in the Apocalypse,
of all the emblematical glory of the Son of
Man, allowed to take silent effect upon the
apostle's spirit, and prepare it for the revelation
of things to come. These heard with all
their absorbed faculties, and with all their
powers addrest them to the bidding of the
Lord. But, if this was in aught flinched from,
witness, in the persecution of the prophet
Jonah, the fearful issues which ensued. From
the presence of the Lord he could not flee.
Fain would he have escaped to the uttermost
parts of the earth; but in the mighty
waters the terrors of the Lord fell upon him;
and when engulfed in the deep, and entombed
in the monster of the deep, still the Lord's
word was upon the obdurate prophet, who had
no rest, not the rest of the grave, till he had
fulfilled it to the very uttermost.</p>

<p>Now, judging that every time we open the
pages of this holy book, we are to be favored
with no less than a communication from on
high, in substance the same as those whereof
we have detailed the three distinct and several
parts, we conceive it due to the majesty of
Him who speaks, that we, in like manner,
discipline our spirits with a due preparation,
and have them in proper frame, before we
listen to the voice; that, while it is disclosing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
to us the important message, we be wrapt in
full attention; and that, when it hath disburdened
itself into our opened and enlarged
spirits, we proceed forthwith to the business
of its fulfilment, whithersoever and to whatsoever
it summon us forth. Upon each of
these three duties, incumbent upon one who
would not forego the benefit of a heavenly
message, we will discourse apart, addressing
ourselves in this discourse to the first-mentioned
of the three.</p>

<p>The preparation for the announcement.&mdash;"When
God uttereth His voice," says the
Psalmist, "coals of fire are kindled; the hills
melt down like wax; the earth quakes; and
deep proclaims itself unto hollow deep."
These sensible images of the Creator have
now vanished, and we are left alone, in the
deep recesses of the meditative mind, to discern
His coming forth. No trump of heaven now
speaketh in the world's ear. No angelic conveyance
of Heaven's will taketh shape from
the vacant air; and having done his errand,
retireth into his airy habitation. No human
messenger putteth forth his miraculous hand
to heal nature's unmedicable wounds, winning
for his words a silent and astonished
audience. Majesty and might no longer precede
the oracles of Heaven. They lie silent
and unobtrusive, wrapt up in their little
compass, one volume among many, innocently
handed to and fro, having no distinction but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
that in which our mustered thoughts are enabled
to invest them. The want of solemn
preparation and circumstantial pomp, the
imagination of the mind hath now to supply.
The presence of the Deity, and the authority
of His voice, our thoughtful spirits must
discern. Conscience must supply the terrors
that were wont to go before Him; and the
brightness of His coming, which the sense can
no longer behold, the heart, ravished with His
word, must feel.</p>

<p>For the solemn vocation of all her powers,
to do her Maker honor and give Him welcome,
it is, at the very least, necessary that the soul
stand absolved from every call. Every foreign
influence or authority arising out of the
world, or the things of the world, should be
burst when about to stand before the fountain
of all authority; every argument, every invention,
every opinion of man forgot, when
about to approach to the Father and oracle
of all intelligence. And as subjects, when
their honors, with invitations, are held disengaged,
tho preoccupied with a thousand
appointments, so, upon an audience, fixt and
about to be holden with the King of Kings,
it will become the honored mortal to break
loose from all thraldom of men and things,
and be arrayed in liberty of thought and
action to drink in the rivers of His pleasure,
and to perform the mission of His lips.</p>

<p>Now far otherwise it hath appeared to us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
that Christians as well as worldly men come
to this most august occupation of listening to
the word of God; preoccupied and prepossest,
inclining to it a partial ear, and straitened
understanding, and a disaffected will.</p>

<p>The Christian public are prone to preoccupy
themselves with the admiration of those
opinions by which they stand distinguished
as a Church or sect from other Christians, and
instead of being quite unfettered to receive
the whole counsel of the Divinity, they are
prepared to welcome it no further than it
bears upon, and stands with opinions which
they already favor. To this pre-judgment
the early use of catechisms mainly contributes,
which, however serviceable in their
place, have the disadvantage of presenting the
truth in a form altogether different from what
it occupies in the world itself. In the one it
is presented to the intellect chiefly (and in our
catechisms to an intellect of a very subtle
order), in the other it is presented more
frequently to the heart, to the affections, to
the emotions, to the fancy, and to all the faculties
of the soul. In early youth, which is so
applied to those compilations, an association
takes place between religion and intellect, and
a divorcement of religion from the other
powers of the inner man. This derangement,
judging from observation and experience, it is
exceedingly difficult to put to rights in afterlife;
and so it comes to pass, that in listening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
to the oracles of religion, the intellect is
chiefly awake, and the better parts of the message&mdash;those
which address the heart and its
affections, those which dilate and enlarge our
admiration of the Godhead, and those which
speak to the various sympathies of our nature&mdash;we
are, by the injudicious use of these narrow
epitomes, disqualified to receive.</p>

<p>In the train of these comes controversy with
its rough voice and unmeek aspect, to disqualify
the soul for a full and fair audience
of its Maker's word. The points of the faith
we have been called on to defend, or which
are reputable with our party, assume, in our
esteem, an importance disproportionate to
their importance in the Word, which we come
to relish chiefly when it goes to sustain them,
and the Bible is hunted for arguments and
texts of controversy, which are treasured up
for future service. The solemn stillness which
the soul should hold before his Maker, so
favorable to meditation and rapt communion
with the throne of God, is destroyed at every
turn by suggestions of what is orthodox and
evangelical&mdash;where all is orthodox and evangelical;
the spirit of such readers becomes
lean, being fed with abstract truths and
formal propositions; their temper uncongenial,
being ever disturbed with controversial
suggestions; their prayers undevout recitals
of their opinions; their discourse technical announcements
of their faith. Intellect, old intellect,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
hath the sway over heavenward devotion
and holy fervor. Man, contentious man,
hath the attention which the unsearchable
God should undivided have; and the fine, full
harmony of heaven's melodious voice, which,
heard apart, were sufficient to lap the soul in
ecstasies unspeakable, is jarred and interfered
with, and the heavenly spell is broken by the
recurring conceits, sophisms, and passions of
men. Now truly an utter degradation it is
of the Godhead to have His word in league
with that of man, or any council of men.
What matter to me whether the Pope, or any
work of any mind, be exalted to the quality of
God? If any helps are to be imposed for the
understanding, or safeguarding, or sustaining
of the word, why not the help of statues
and pictures of my devotions? Therefore,
while the warm fancies of the Southerns have
given their idolatry to the ideal forms of noble
art, let us Northerns beware we give not our
idolatry to the cold and coarse abstractions of
human intellect.</p>

<p>For the preoccupations of worldly minds,
they are not to be reckoned up, being manifold
as their favorite passions and pursuits. One
thing only can be said, that before coming to
the oracles of God they are not preoccupied
with the expectation and fear of Him. No
chord in their heart is in unison with things
unseen; no moments are set apart for religious
thought and meditation; no anticipations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the honored interview; no prayer of preparation
like that of Daniel before Gabriel was
sent to teach him; no devoutness like that of
Cornelius before the celestial visitation; no
fastings like that of Peter before the revelation
of the glory of the Gentiles! Now to
minds which are not attuned to holiness, the
words of God find no entrance, striking heavy
on the ear, seldom making way to the understanding,
almost never to the heart. To
spirits hot with conversation, perhaps heady
with argument, uncomposed by solemn
thought, but ruffled and in uproar from the
concourse of worldly interests, the sacred page
may be spread out, but its accents are
drowned in the noise which hath not yet subsided
in the breast. All the awe, and pathos,
and awakened consciousness of a Divine
approach, imprest upon the ancients by the
procession of solemnities, is to worldly men
without a substitute. They have not yet
solicited themselves to be in readiness. In a
usual mood and vulgar frame they come to
God's word as to other compositions, reading
it without any active imaginations about Him
who speaks; feeling no awe of a sovereign
Lord, nor care of a tender Father, nor devotion
to a merciful Savior. Nowise deprest
themselves out of their wonted dependence,
nor humiliated before the King of Kings&mdash;no
prostrations of the soul, nor falling at His
feet as dead&mdash;no exclamation, as of Isaiah,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
"Wo is me, for I am of unclean lips!"&mdash;no
request "Send me"&mdash;nor fervent ejaculation
of welcome, as of Samuel, "Lord, speak, for
Thy servant heareth!" Truly they feel toward
His word much as to the word of an
equal. No wonder it shall fail of happy influence
upon the spirits which have, as it were,
on purpose, disqualified themselves for its
benefits by removing from the regions of
thought and feeling which it accords with,
into other regions, which it is of too severe
dignity to affect, otherwise than with stern
menace and direful foreboding! If they
would have it bless them and do them good,
they must change their manner of approaching
it, and endeavor to bring themselves into
that prepared, and collected, and reverential
frame which becomes an interview with the
High and Holy One who inhabiteth the
praises of eternity.</p>

<p>Having thus spoken without equivocation,
and we hope without offense, to the contradictoriness
and preoccupation with which
Christians and worldly men are apt to come to
the perusal of the Word of God, we shall now
set forth the two master-feelings under which
we shall address ourselves to the sacred occupation.</p>

<p>It is a good custom, inherited from the
hallowed days of Scottish piety, and in our
cottages still preserved, tho in our cities
generally given up, to preface the morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
and evening worship of the family with a
short invocation of blessing from the Lord.
This is in unison with the practise and recommendation
of pious men, never to open the
Divine Word without a silent invocation of
the Divine Spirit. But no address to heaven
is of any virtue, save as it is the expression of
certain pious sentiments with which the mind
is full and overflowing. Of those sentiments
which befit the mind that comes into conference
with its Maker, the first and most prominent
should be gratitude for His ever having
condescended to hold commerce with such
wretched and fallen creatures. Gratitude not
only expressing itself in proper terms, but
possessing the mind with one abiding and
over-mastering mood, under which it shall sit
imprest the whole duration of the interview.
Such an emotion as can not utter itself in
language&mdash;tho by language it indicates its
presence&mdash;but keeps us in a devout and adoring
frame, while the Lord is uttering His
voice.</p>

<p>Go visit a desolate widow with consolation,
and help, and fatherhood of her orphan
children&mdash;do it again and again&mdash;and your
presence, the sound of your approaching
footstep, the soft utterance of your voice, the
very mention of your name, shall come to
dilate her heart with a fulness which defies
her tongue to utter, but speaking by the
tokens of a swimming eye, and clasped hands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
and fervent ejaculations to heaven upon your
head! No less copious acknowledgment of
God, the author of our well-being, and the
Father of our better hopes, ought we to feel
when His Word discloseth to us the excess of
His love. Tho a veil be now cast over the
Majesty which speaks, it is the voice of the
Eternal which we hear, coming in soft cadences
to win our favor, yet omnipotent as the voice
of the thunder, and overpowering as the rushing
of many waters. And tho the evil of
the future intervene between our hand and
the promised goods, still are they from His
lips who speaks, and it is done, who commands,
and all things stand fast. With no
less emotion, therefore, should this book be
opened, than if, like him in the Apocalypse,
you saw the voice which spake; or, like him in
the trance, you were into the third heaven
translated, companying and communing with
the realities of glory which the eye hath not
seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man
conceived.</p>

<p>Far and foreign from such an opened and
awakened bosom is that cold and formal hand
which is generally laid upon the sacred
volume; that unfeeling and unimpressive tone
with which its accents are pronounced; and
that listless and incurious ear into which its
blessed sounds are received. How can you,
thus unimpassioned, hold communion with
themes in which everything awful, vital, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
endearing meet together? Why is not
curiosity, curiosity ever hungry, on edge
to know the doings and intentions of
Jehovah, King of Kings? Why is not
interest, interest ever awake, on tip-toe to
hear the future destiny of itself? Why
is not the heart, that panteth over the
world after love and friendship, overpowered
with the full tide of the divine acts and expressions
of love? Where is nature gone when
she is not moved with the tender mercy of
Christ? Methinks the affections of men are
fallen into the yellow leaf. Of the poets which
charm the world's ear, who is he that inditeth
a song unto his God? Some will tune their
harps to sensual pleasure, and by the enchantment
of their genius well-nigh commend their
unholy themes to the imagination of saints.
Others, to the high and noble sentiments of the
heart, will sing of domestic joys and happy
unions, casting around sorrow the radiancy of
virtue, and bodying forth, in undying forms,
the short-lived visions of joy! Others have
enrolled themselves the high-priests of mute
nature's charms, enchanting her echoes with
their minstrelsy, and peopling her solitudes
with the bright creatures of their fancy. But
when, since the days of the blind master of
English song, hath any poured forth a lay
worthy of the Christian theme? Nor in philosophy,
"the palace of the soul," have men
been more mindful of their Maker. The flowers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
of the garden and the herbs of the field
have their unwearied devotees, crossing the
ocean, wayfaring in the desert, and making
devout pilgrimages to every region of nature
for offerings to their patron muse. The rocks,
from their residences among the clouds to
their deep rests in the dark bowels of the
earth, have a bold and most venturous priesthood,
who see in their rough and flinty faces
a more delectable image to adore than in the
revealed countenance of God. And the political
warfare of the world is a very Moloch,
who can at any time command his hecatomb of
human victims. But the revealed suspense of
God, to which the harp of David, and the
prophetic lyre of Isaiah were strung, the prudence
of God, which the wisest of men coveted
after, preferring it to every gift which heaven
could confer, and the eternal intelligence
Himself in human form, and the unction of
the Holy One which abideth&mdash;these the common
heart of man hath forsaken, and refused
to be charmed withal.</p>

<p>I testify, that there ascendeth not from
earth a hosanna of her children to bear witness
in the ear of the upper regions to the
wonderful manifestations of her God! From
a few scattered hamlets in a small portion of
her territory a small voice ascendeth, like the
voice of one crying in the wilderness. But to
the service of our general Preserver there is
no concourse, from Dan unto Beersheba, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
our people, the greater part of whom, after
two thousand years of apostolic commission,
have not the testimonials of our God; and the
multitude of those who disrespect or despise
them!</p>

<p>But, to return from this lamentation,
which may God hear, who doth not disregard
the cries of His afflicted people! With the full
sense of obligation to the giver, combine a
humble sense of your own incapacity to value
and to use the gift of His oracles. Having no
taste whatever for the mean estimates which
are made, and the coarse invectives that are
vented, against human nature, which, tho
true in the main, are often in the manner so
unfeeling and triumphant, as to reveal hot
zeal rather than tender and deep sorrow, we
will not give in to this popular strain. And
yet it is a truth by experience,
revealed, that
tho there be in man most noble faculties,
and a nature restless after the knowledge and
truth of things, there are toward God and His
revealed will an indisposition and a regardlessness,
which the most tender and enlightened
consciences are the most ready to
acknowledge. Of our emancipated youth,
who, bound after the knowledge of the visible
works of God, and the gratification of the
various instincts of nature, how few betake
themselves at all, how few absorb themselves
with the study and obedience of the Word of
God! And when, by God's visitation, we address<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
ourselves to the task, how slow is our
progress and how imperfect our performance!
It is most true that nature is unwilling to the
subject of the Scriptures. The soul is previously
possest with adverse interests; the
world hath laid an embargo on her faculties,
and monopolized them to herself; old habit
hath perhaps added to his almost incurable
callousness; and the enemy of God and man is
skilful to defend what he hath already won.
So circumstanced, and every man is so circumstanced,
we come to the audience of the Word
of God, and listen in the worse tune than a
wanton to a sermon, or a hardened knave to a
judicial address. Our understanding is prepossest
with a thousand idols of the world&mdash;religious
or irreligious&mdash;which corrupt the
reading of the Word into a straining of the
text to their service, and when it will not
strain, cause it to be skimmed, and perhaps
despised or hated. Such a thing as a free and
unlimited reception of all parts of the Scripture
into the mind, is a thing most rare to be
met with, and when met with will be found
the result of many a sore submission of
nature's opinions as well as of nature's
likings.</p>

<p>But the Word, as hath been said, is not for
the intellect alone, but for the heart, and for
the will. Now if any one be so wedded to his
own candor as to think he doth accept the
divine truth unabated, surely no one will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
flatter himself into the belief that his heart
is attuned and enlarged for all divine commandments.
The man who thus misdeems of
himself must, if his opinions were just, be like
a sheet of fair paper, unblotted and unwritten
on; whereas all men are already occupied,
to the very fulness, with other opinions and
attachments and desires than the Word reveals.
We do not grow Christians by the same
culture by which we grow men, otherwise what
need of divine revelation, and divine assistance?
But being unacquainted from the womb
with God, and attached to what is seen and
felt, through early and close acquaintance, we
are ignorant and detached from what is unseen
and unfelt. The Word is a novelty to
our nature, its truths fresh truths, its affections
fresh affections, its obedience gathered
from the apprehension of nature and the commerce
of the worldly life. Therefore there
needeth, in one that would be served from this
storehouse opened by heaven, a disrelish of his
old acquisitions, and a preference of the new,
a simple, child-like teachableness, an allowance
of ignorance and error, with whatever
else beseems an anxious learner. Coming to
the Word of God, we are like children brought
into the conversations of experienced men;
and we should humbly listen and reverently
inquire; or we are like raw rustics introduced
into high and polished life, and we should
unlearn our coarseness, and copy the habits of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
the station; nay we are like offenders caught,
and for the moment committed to the bosom
of honorable society, with the power of regaining
our lost condition and inheriting honor
and trust&mdash;therefore we should walk softly and
tenderly, covering our former reproach with
modesty and humbleness, hasting to redeem
our reputation by distinguished performances,
against offense doubly guarded, doubly watchful
for dangerous and extreme positions to
demonstrate our recovered goodness.</p>

<p>These two sentiments&mdash;devout veneration of
God for His unspeakable gift, and deep distrust
of our capacity to estimate and use it
aright&mdash;will generate in the mind a constant
aspiration after the guidance and instruction
of a higher power; the first sentiment
of goodness remembered, emboldening us to
draw near to Him who first drew near to us,
and who with Christ will not refuse us any
gift; the second sentiment, of weakness remembered,
teaching us our need, and prompting
us by every interest of religion and every
feeling of helplessness to seek of Him who
hath said, "If any one lack wisdom let him
ask God, who giveth liberally and upbraideth
not." The soul which under these two
master-feelings cometh to read, shall not read
without profit. Every new revelation, feeding
his gratitude and nourishing his former ignorance,
will confirm the emotions he is under,
and carry them onward to an unlimited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
dimension. Such a one will prosper in the
way; enlargement of the inner man will be his
portion and the establishment in the truth
his exceeding great reward. "In the strength
of the Lord shall his right hand get victory&mdash;even
in the name of the Lord of Hosts. His
soul shall also flourish with the fruits of righteousness
from the seed of the word, which
liveth and abideth forever."</p>

<p>Thus delivered from prepossessions of all
other masters, and arrayed in the raiment of
humility and love, the soul should advance
to the meeting of her God; and she should
call a muster of her faculties and have all her
poor grace in attendance, and anything she
knows of His excellent works and exalted
ways she should summon up to her remembrance;
her understanding she should quicken,
her memory refresh, her imagination stimulate,
her affections cherish, and her conscience
arouse. All that is within her should be
stirred up, her whole glory should awake and
her whole beauty display itself for the meeting
of her King. As His hand-maiden she
should meet Him; His own handiwork, tho
sore defaced, yet seeking restoration; His
humble, because offending, servant&mdash;yet nothing
slavish, tho humble&mdash;nothing superstitious,
tho devout&mdash;nothing tame, tho modest
in her demeanor; but quick and ready, all
addrest and wound up for her Maker's will.</p>

<p>How different the ordinary proceeding of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
Christians, who, with timorous, mistrustful
spirits, with an abeyance of intellect, and a
dwarfish reduction of their natural powers,
enter to the conference of the Word of God!
The natural powers of man are to be mistrusted,
doubtless, as the willing instruments
of the evil one; but they must be honored also
as the necessary instruments of the Spirit of
God, whose operation is a dream, if it be not
through knowledge, intellect, conscience, and
action. Now Christians, heedless of the grand
resurrection of the mighty instruments of
thought and action, at the same time coveting
hard after holy attainment, do often resign
the mastery of themselves, and are taken into
the counsel of the religious world&mdash;whirling
around the eddy of some popular leader&mdash;and
so drifted, I will not say from godliness, but
drifted certainly from that noble, manly and
independent course, which, under steerage of
the Word of God, they might safely have pursued
for the precious interests of their immortal
souls. Meanwhile these popular
leaders, finding no necessity for strenuous endeavors
and high science in the ways of God,
but having a gathering host to follow them,
deviate from the ways of deep and penetrating
thought&mdash;refuse the contest with the literary
and accomplished enemies of the faith&mdash;bring
a contempt upon the cause in which
mighty men did formerly gird themselves to
the combat&mdash;and so cast the stumbling-block<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
of a mistaken paltryness between enlightened
men and the cross of Christ! So far from this
simple-mindedness (but its proper name is
feeble-mindedness), Christians should be&mdash;as
aforetime in this island they were wont to be&mdash;the
princes of human intellect, the lights of
the world, the salt of the political and social
state. Till they come forth from the swaddling-bands,
in which foreign schools have
girt them, and walk boldly upon the high
places of human understanding, they shall
never obtain that influence in the upper
regions of knowledge and power, of which,
unfortunately, they have not the apostolic
unction to be in quest. They will never be the
master and commanding spirit of the time,
until they cast off the wrinkled and withered
skin of an obsolete old age, and clothe themselves
with intelligence as with a garment, and
bring forth the fruits of power and love and
of a sound mind.</p>

<p>Mistake us not, for we steer in a narrow,
very narrow channel, with rocks of popular
prejudice on every side. While we thus invocate
to the reading of the Word, the highest
strains of the human soul, mistake us not as
derogating from the office of the Spirit of God.
Far be it from any Christian, much further
from any Christian pastor, to withdraw from
God the honor which is everywhere His due;
but there most of all His due where the human
mind labored alone for thousands of years,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
and labored with no success&mdash;viz., the regeneration
of itself, and its restoration to the last
semblance of the divinity! Oh! let him be
reverently inquired after, devoutly meditated
on, and most thankfully acknowledged in
every step of progress from the soul's fresh
awakening out of her dark, oblivious sleep&mdash;even
to her ultimate attainment upon earth
and full accomplishment for heaven. And
there may be a fuller choir of awakened men
to advance His honor and glory here on earth,
and hereafter in heaven above; let the saints
bestir themselves like angels and the ministers
of religion like archangels strong! And now
at length let us have a demonstration made of
all that is noble in thought, and generous in
action, and devoted in piety, for bestirring
this lethargy, and breaking the bonds of hell,
and redeeming the whole world to the service
of its God and King!</p>

<h4>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</h4>


<p>Thomas Arnold, schoolmaster and
preacher, was born at West Cowes, Isle
of Wight, in 1795. He was educated at
Oxford, and after his graduation taught
as fellow of Oriel College, until in 1820
he removed to Laleham near Haines and

In 1827 he was elected to the head mastership
of Rugby, and took priest's orders
before entering upon his duties. At
Rugby he remained till his death in 1842.
His great work as an educator consisted
in teaching boys the duty of self-government,
self-control and freedom of intellectual
judgement. His sermons in the
school chapel were distinguished by simplicity
and profound moral and religious
earnestness.</p>

<h3>1795-1842</h3>

<h4>ALIVE IN GOD</h4>

<p><em>God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</em>&mdash;Matt.
xxii., 32.</p>


<p>We hear these words as a part of our
Lord's answer to the Sadducees;
and as their question was put in
evident profaneness, and the answer to it is
one which to our minds is quite obvious and
natural, so we are apt to think that in this
particular story there is less than usual that
particularly concerns us. But it so happens
that our Lord in answering the Sadducees has
brought in one of the most universal and most
solemn of all truths,&mdash;which is indeed implied
in many parts of the Old Testament, but
which the Gospel has revealed to us in all its
fulness,&mdash;the truth contained in the words of
the text, that "God is not the God of the
dead, but of the living."</p>

<p>I would wish to unfold a little what is contained
in these words which we often hear,
even, perhaps, without quite understanding
them, and many times oftener without fully
entering into them. And we may take them,
without fully entering into them. And we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
may take them, first, in their first part, where
they say that "God is not the God of the
dead."</p>

<p>The word "dead," we know, is constantly
used in Scripture in a double sense, as meaning
those who are dead spiritually as well as
those who are dead naturally. And in either
sense the words are alike applicable: "God is
not the God of the dead."</p>

<p>God's not being the God of the dead signifies
two things: that they who are without Him
are dead, as well as that they who are dead
are also without Him. So far as our knowledge
goes respecting inferior animals they appear
to be examples of this truth. They appear
to us to have no knowledge of God; and we
are not told that they have any other life than
the short one of which our senses inform us.
I am well aware that our ignorance of their
condition is so great that we may not dare to
say anything of them positively; there may
be a hundred things true respecting them
which we neither know nor imagine. I would
only say that according to that most imperfect
light in which we see them the two points
of which I have been speaking appear to meet
in them: we believe that they have no consciousness
of God, and we believe that they will die.
And so far, therefore, they afford an example
of the agreement, if I may so speak, between
these two points; and were intended, perhaps,
to be to our view a continual image of it. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
we had far better speak of ourselves. And
here, too, it is the case that "God is not the
God of the dead." If we are without Him
we are dead, and if we are dead we are without
Him; in other words, the two ideas of
death and absence from God are in fact
synonymous.</p>

<p>Thus, in the account given of the fall of
man, the sentence of death and of being cast
out of Eden go together; and if any one compares
the description of the second Eden in
the Revelation, and recollects how especially
it is there said that God dwells in the midst
of it, and is its light by day and night, he will
see that the banishment from the first Eden
means a banishment from the presence of God.
And thus, in the day that Adam sinned he
died; for he was cast out of Eden immediately,
however long he may have moved about
afterward upon the earth where God was not.
And how very strong to the same point are
the words of Hezekiah's prayer, "The grave
cannot praise Thee, Death cannot celebrate
Thee; they that go down into the pit cannot
hope for Thy truth"; words which express
completely the feeling that God is not the
God of the dead. This, too, appears to be the
sense generally of the expression used in various
parts of the Old Testament, "Thou shalt
surely die."</p>

<p>It is, no doubt, left purposely obscure; nor
are we ever told in so many words all that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
meant by death; but, surely, it always implies
a separation from God, and the being&mdash;whatever
the notion may extend to&mdash;the being dead
to Him.</p>

<p>Thus, when David had committed his great
sin and had expressed his repentance for it,
Nathan tells him, "The Lord also hath put
away thy sin; thou shalt not die"; which
means most expressively, thou shalt not die to
God.</p>

<p>In one sense David died, as all men die; nor
was he by any means freed from the punishment
of his sin; he was not, in that sense, forgiven,
but he was allowed still to regard God
as his God; and therefore his punishments
were but fatherly chastisements from God's
hand, designed for his profit that he might be
partaker of God's holiness.</p>

<p>And thus altho Saul was sentenced to
lose his kingdom, and altho he was killed
with his sons on Mount Gilboa, yet I do not
think that we find the sentence passed upon
him, "Thou shalt surely die"; and therefore
we have no right to say that God had ceased
to be his God altho He visited him with severe
chastisements and would not allow him
to hand down to his sons the crown of Israel.
Observe also the language of the eighteenth
chapter of Ezekiel, where the expressions occur
so often, "He shall surely live," and "He
shall surely die."</p>

<p>We have no right to refer these to a mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
extension on the one hand, or a cutting short
on the other, of the term of earthly existence.
The promise of living long in the land or, as
in Hezekiah's case, of adding to his days fifteen
years, is very different from the full and
unreserved blessing, "Thou shalt surely live."
And we know, undoubtedly, that both the
good and the bad to whom Ezekiel spoke died
alike the natural death of the body. But the
peculiar force of the promise and of the threat
was, in the one case, Thou shalt belong to God;
in the other, Thou shalt cease to belong to
Him; although the veil was not yet drawn up
which concealed the full import of those
terms, "belonging to God," and "ceasing to
belong to Him": nay, can we venture to affirm
that it is fully drawn aside even now?</p>

<p>I have dwelt on this at some length, because
it really seems to place the common state of
the minds of too many amongst us in a light
which is exceedingly awful; for if it be true,
as I think the Scripture implies, that to be
dead and to be without God are precisely the
same thing, then can it be denied that the
symptoms of death are strongly marked upon
many of us? Are there not many who never
think of God or care about His service? Are
there not many who live, to all appearance,
as unconscious of His existence, as we fancy
the inferior animals to be?</p>

<p>And is it not quite clear that to such persons
God cannot be said to be their God? He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
may be the God of heaven and earth, the God
of the universe, the God of Christ's Church;
but He is not their God, for they feel to have
nothing at all to do with Him; and therefore,
as He is not their God, they are, and must be
according to the Scripture, reckoned among
the dead.</p>

<p>But God is the God "of the living." That
is, as before, all who are alive live unto Him;
all who live unto Him are alive. "God said, I
am the God of Abraham, and the God of
Isaac, and the God of Jacob"; and therefore,
says our Lord, "Abraham, and Isaac, and
Jacob are not and cannot be dead." They
cannot be dead, because God owns them: He
is not ashamed to be called their God; therefore
they are not cast out from Him; therefore,
by necessity, they live.</p>

<p>Wonderful, indeed, is the truth here implied,
in exact agreement, as we have seen,
with the general language of Scripture; that,
as she who but touched the hem of Christ's
garment was in a moment relieved from her
infirmity, so great was the virtue which went
out from Him; so they who are not cast out
from God, but have anything whatever to do
with Him, feel the virtue of His gracious presence
penetrating their whole nature; because
He lives, they must live also.</p>

<p>Behold, then, life and death set before us;
not remote (if a few years be, indeed, to be
called remote), but even now present before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
us; even now suffered or enjoyed. Even now,
we are alive unto God, or dead unto God; and,
as we are either the one or the other, so we
are, in the highest possible sense of the terms,
alive or dead. In the highest possible sense
of the terms; but who can tell what that highest
possible sense of the terms is? So much
has, indeed, been revealed to us, that we know
now that death means a conscious and perpetual
death, as life means a conscious and
perpetual life.</p>

<p>But greatly, indeed, do we deceive ourselves,
if we fancy that, by having thus much
told us, we have also risen to the infinite
heights, or descended to the infinite depths,
contained in those little words, life and death.
They are far higher, and far deeper, than ever
thought or fancy of man has reached to. But,
even on the first edge of either, at the visible
beginnings of that infinite ascent or descent,
there is surely something which may give us
a foretaste of what is beyond. Even to us
in this mortal state, even to you, advanced but
so short a way on your very earthly journey,
life and death have a meaning: to be dead
unto God, or to be alive to Him, are things
perceptibly different.</p>

<p>For, let me ask of those who think least of
God, who are most separate from Him, and
most without Him, whether there is not now
actually, perceptibly, in their state, something
of the coldness, the loneliness, the fearfulness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
of death? I do not ask them whether they
are made unhappy by the fear of God's anger;
of course they are not: for they who fear God
are not dead to Him, nor He to them.</p>

<p>The thought of Him gives them no disquiet
at all; this is the very point we start from.
But I would ask them whether they know
what it is to feel God's blessing. For instance:
we all of us have our troubles of some
sort or other, our disappointments, if not our
sorrows. In these troubles, in these disappointments,&mdash;I
care not how small they may
be,&mdash;have they known what it is to feel that
God's hand is over them; that these little annoyances
are but His fatherly correction;
that He is all the time loving us, and supporting
us? In seasons of joy, such as they taste
very often, have they known what it is to
feel that they are tasting the kindness of their
heavenly Father, that their good things come
from His hand and are but an infinitely slight
foretaste of His love? Sickness, danger; I
know that they come to many of us but rarely;
but if we have known them, or at least sickness,
even in its lighter form, if not in its
graver,&mdash;have we felt what it is to know that
we are in our Father's hands, that He is with
us, and will be with us to the end; that nothing
can hurt those whom He loves?</p>

<p>Surely, then, if we have never tasted anything
of this: if in trouble, or in joy, or in
sickness, we are left wholly to ourselves to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
bear as we can and enjoy as we can; if there
is no voice that ever speaks out of the heights
and the depths around us to give any answer
to our own; if we are thus left to ourselves
in this vast world,&mdash;there is in this a coldness
and a loneliness; and whenever we come to
be, of necessity, driven to be with our own
hearts alone, the coldness and the loneliness
must be felt. But consider that the things
which we see around us cannot remain with
us nor we with them. The coldness and loneliness
of the world, without God, must be felt
more and more as life wears on; in every
change of our own state, in every separation
from or loss of a friend, in every more sensible
weakness of our own bodies, in every
additional experience of the uncertainty of
our own counsels,&mdash;the deathlike feeling will
come upon us more and more strongly: we
shall gain more of that fearful knowledge
which tells us that "God is not the God of
the dead."</p>

<p>And so, also, the blessed knowledge that
He is the God "of the living" grows upon
those who are truly alive. Surely He "is not
far from every one of us." No occasion of life
fails to remind those who live unto Him that
He is their God and that they are His children.
On light occasions or on grave ones,
in sorrow and in joy, still the warmth of His
love is spread, as it were, all through the atmosphere
of their lives; they forever feel His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
blessing. And if it fills them with joy unspeakable
even now, when they so often feel
how little they deserve it; if they delight still
in being with God, and in living to Him, let
them be sure that they have in themselves the
unerring witness of life eternal: God is the
God of the living, and all who are with Him
must live.</p>

<p>Hard it is, I well know, to bring this home
in any degree to the minds of those who are
dead; for it is of the very nature of the dead
that they can hear no words of life. But it
has happened that, even whilst writing what
I have just been uttering to you, the news
reached me that one who two months ago was
one of your number, who this very half-year
has shared in all the business and amusements
of this place, is passed already into that state
where the meanings of the terms life and
death are become fully revealed. He knows
what it is to live unto God and what it is to
die to Him. Those things which are to us unfathomable
mysteries are to him all plain: and
yet but two months ago he might have thought
himself as far from attaining this knowledge
as any of us can do. Wherefore it is clear
that these things, life and death, may hurry
their lesson upon us sooner than we deem of,
sooner than we are prepared to receive it.
And that were indeed awful, if, being dead
to God, and yet little feeling it because of the
enjoyments of our worldly life, those enjoyments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
were on a sudden to be struck away
from us, and we should find then that to be
dead to God was death indeed, a death from
which there is no waking, and in which there
is no sleeping forever.</p>

<h4>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</h4>


<p>Francis Wayland, preacher and philosopher,
was born in New York, in 1796.
He graduated at Union College in 1813
and in 1816 entered Hudson Theological
Seminary. His first charge was the First
Baptist Church in Boston. Here he established
his reputation as an able and
vigorous pulpit orator. Five years later
he accepted a chair in Union College,
but in 1827 entered upon an incumbency
of twenty-eight years as President of
Brown University, Providence. This institution
he built up on a broad and
liberal basis, quite emancipating it from
narrow sectarianism. In 1855 he became
pastor of the First Baptist Church in
Providence and died in 1865.</p>

<h3>1796-1865</h3>

<h4>A DAY IN THE LIFE OF JESUS OF
NAZARETH</h4>

<p><em>And the apostles, when they were returned, told him
all that they had done. And he took them, and went
aside privately into a desert place, belonging to the
city called Bethsaida. And the people when they
knew it, followed him: and he received them, and
spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and healed
them that had need of healing. And when the day
began to wear away, then came the twelve, and said
unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may
go into the towns and country round about, and lodge
and get victuals: for we are here in a desert place.
But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they
said, We have no more but five loaves and two fishes;
except we should go and buy meat for all this people.
For they were about five thousand men. And he said
to his disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a
company. And they did so, and made them all sit
down. Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes
and looking up to heaven, he blessed them and brake,
and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.
And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was
taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve
baskets.</em>&mdash;Luke ix., 10-17.</p>


<p>It was the sagacious opinion of, I think,
the late Professor Porson, that he would
rather see a single copy of a daily newspaper
of ancient Athens, than read all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
commentaries upon the Grecian tragedies that
have ever been written. The reason for this
preference is obvious. A single sheet, similar
to our daily newspapers, published in the
time of Pericles, would admit us at once to
a knowledge of the habits, manners, modes of
opinion, political relations, social condition,
and moral attainments of the people, such as
we never could gain from the study of all the
writers that have ever attempted to illustrate
the nature of Grecian civilization.</p>

<p>The same remark is true in respect to our
knowledge of the character of individuals who
have lived in a former age. What would we
not, at the present day, give for a few pages
of the private diary of Julius Cesar, or Cicero,
or Brutus, or Augustus; or for the minute
reminiscences of any one who had spent a few
days in the company of either of these distinguished
men? What a flood of life would
the discovery of such a manuscript throw
upon Roman life, but especially upon the
private opinions, the motives, the aspirations,
the moral estimates of the men whose names
have become household words throughout the
world! A few such pages might, perchance,
dissipate the authority of many a bulky folio
on which we now rely with implicit confidence.
Not only would the characters of these heroes
of antiquity stand out in bolder relief than
they have ever done before, but the individuals
themselves would be brought within the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
range of our personal sympathy; and we
should seem to commune with them as we do
with an intimate acquaintance.</p>

<p>It is worthy of remark, that we are favored
with a larger portion of this kind of information,
respecting Jesus of Nazareth, than almost
any other distinguished person that has
ever lived. He left no writings Himself;
hence all that we know of Him has been written
by others. The narrators, however, were
the personal attendants, and not the mere
auditors or pupils of their master. The apostles
were members of the family of Jesus; they
traveled with Him, on foot, throughout the
length and breadth of Palestine; they partook
with Him of his frugal meals, and bore
with Him the trial of hunger, weariness, and
want of shelter; they followed Him through
the lonely wilderness and the crowded street;
they saw His miracles in every variety of
form, and listened to His discourses in public
as well as to His explanations in private.
Hence their whole narrative is instinct with
life; a vivid picture of Jewish manners and
customs, rendered more definite and characteristic
by the moral light which then, for the
first time, shone upon it. Hence it is that
these few pages are replete with moral lessons
that never weary us in the perusal, and which
have been the source of unfailing illumination
to all succeeding ages.</p>

<p>The verses which I have read, as the text of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
this discourse, may well be taken as an illustration
of all that I have here said. They
may, without impropriety, be styled a day in
the life of Jesus of Nazareth. By observing
the manner in which our blessed Lord spent a
single day, we may form some conception of
the kind of life which He ordinarily led; and
we may, perchance, treasure up some lessons
which it were well if we should exemplify in
our daily practice.</p>

<p>The place at which these events occurred
was near the head of the Sea of Galilee, where
it receives the waters of the upper Jordan.
This was one of the Savior's favorite places
of resort. Capernaum, Chorazin, and Bethsaida,
all in this immediate vicinity, are always
spoken of in the gospels as towns which
enjoyed the largest share of His ministerial
labors, and were distinguished most frequently
with the honor of His personal presence.
The scenery of the neighborhood is wild
and romantic. To the north and west, the eye
rests on the lofty summits of Lebanon and
Hermon. To the south, there opens upon the
view the blue expanse of the lake, enclosed by
frowning rocks, which here and there jut
over far into the waters, and then again retire
towards the land, leaving a level beach to invite
the labors of the fishermen. The people,
removed at a considerable distance from the
metropolis of Judea, cultivated those rural habits
with which the simple tastes of the Savior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
would most readily harmonize. Near this spot
was also one of the most frequented fords of
the Jordan, on the road from Damascus to
Jerusalem; and thus, while residing here, He
enjoyed unusual facilities for disseminating
throughout this whole region a knowledge of
those truths which He came on earth to promulgate.</p>

<p>Some weeks previous to the time in which
the events spoken of in the text occurred, our
Lord had sent His disciples to announce the
approach of the kingdom of heaven, in all the
cities and villages which He Himself proposed
to visit. He conferred on them the power to
work miracles, in attestation of their authority,
and of the divine character of Him by
whom they were sent. He imposed upon
them strict rules of conduct, and directed
them to make known to every one who would
hear them the good news of the coming dispensation.
As soon as He sent them forth, He
Himself went immediately abroad to teach and
to preach in their cities. As their Master and
Lord, He might reasonably have claimed exemption
from the personal toil and the rigid
self-denials to which they were by necessity
subjected. But He had laid no claim to such
exemption. He commenced without delay the
performance of the very same duties which He
had imposed upon them. He felt himself
under obligation to set an example of obedience
to His own rules. "The Son of Man,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
said He, "came not to be ministered unto,
but to minister, and to give His life a ransom
for many." "Which," said He, "is greater,
he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth?
but I am among you as He that serveth."
Would it not be well, if, in this respect, we
copied more minutely the example of our
Lord, and held ourselves responsible for the
performance of the very same duties which
we so willingly impose upon our brethren?
We best prove that we believe an act obligatory,
when we commence the performance of
it ourselves. Many zealous Christians employ
themselves in no other labor than that of
urging their brethren to effort. Our Savior
acted otherwise. In this respect, His example
is specially to be imitated by His ministers.
When they urge upon others a moral duty,
they must be the first to perform it. When
they inculcate an act of self-denial, they themselves
must make the noblest sacrifice. Can
we conceive of anything which could so much
increase the moral power of the ministry, and
rouse to a flame the dormant energy of the
churches, as obedience to this teaching of
Christ by the preachers of His gospel?</p>

<p>It seems that the Savior had selected a
well-known spot, at the head of the lake, for
the place of meeting for his apostles, after this
their first missionary tour had been completed.
"The apostles gathered themselves unto
Jesus, and told Him all things, both what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
they had done, and what they had taught."
There is something delightful in this filial
confidence which these simple-hearted men
reposed in their almighty Redeemer. They
told Him of their success and their failure,
of their wisdom and their folly, of their reliance
and their unbelief. We can almost imagine
ourselves spectators of this meeting
between Christ and them, after this their first
separation from each other. The place appointed
was most probably some well-known
locality on the shore of the lake, under the
shadow of its overhanging rocks, where the
cool air from the bosom of the water refreshed
each returning laborer, as he came back
beaten out with the fatigues of travel, under
the burning sun of Syria. You can imagine
the joy with which each drew near to the Master,
after this temporary absence; and the
honest greetings with which every newcomer
was welcomed by those who had chanced to
arrive before him. We can seem to perceive
the Savior of men listening with affectionate
earnestness to the recital of their various adventures;
and interposing, from time to time,
a word either of encouragement or of caution,
as the character and circumstances of each
narrator required it. The bosom of each was
unveiled before the Searcher of Hearts, and
the consolation which each one needed was bestowed
upon him abundantly. The toilsomeness
of their journey was no longer remembered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
as each one received from the Son of
God the smile of His approbation. That was
truly a joyful meeting. Of all that company
there is not one who has forgotten that day;
nor will he forget it ever. With unreserved
frankness they told Jesus of all that they had
done, and what they had taught; of all their
acts, and all their conversations. Would it
not be better for us, if we cultivated more
assiduously this habit of intimate intercourse
with the Savior? Were we every day to tell
Jesus of all that we have done and said; did
we spread before Him our joys and our sorrows,
our faults and our infirmities, our successes
and our failures, we should be saved
from many an error and many a sin. Setting
the Lord always before us, He would be on
our right hand, and we should not be moved.
"He that dwelleth in the secret place of the
most High shall abide under the shadow of
the Almighty."</p>

<p>The Savior perceived that the apostles
needed much instruction which could not be
communicated in a place where both He and
they were so well known. They had committed
many errors, which He preferred to
correct in private. By doing His will, they
had learned to repose greater confidence in
His wisdom, and were prepared to receive
from Him more important instruction. But
these lessons could not be delivered in the
hearing of a promiscuous audience. Nor was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
this all. He perceived that the apostles were
worn out with their labors, and needed repose.
Surrounded as they were by the multitude,
which had already begun to collect about
them, rest and retirement were equally impossible.
"There were many coming and going,
and they had no leisure, even so much as to
eat." He therefore said to them, "Come ye
yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest
a while." For this purpose, He "took ship,
and crossed over with his disciples alone, and
went into a desert place belonging to Bethsaida."</p>

<p>The religion of Christ imposes upon us
duties of retirement, as well as duties of publicity.
The apostles had been for some time
past before the eyes of all men, preaching and
working miracles. Their souls needed retirement.
"Solitude," said Cecil, "is my great
ordinance." They would be greatly improved
by private communion both with Him and
with each other. It was for the purpose of
affording them such a season of moral recreation,
that our Lord withdrew them from the
public gaze into a desert place. Nor was this
all. Their labor for some weeks past had
been severe. They had traveled on foot
under a tropical sun, reasoning with unbelievers,
instructing the ignorant, and comforting
the cast-down. Called upon, at all hours,
both of the day and night, to work cures on
those that were opprest with diseases, their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
bodies, no less than their spirits, needed rest.
Our Lord saw this, and He made provision
for it. He withdrew them from labor, that
they might find, tho it were but for a day,
the repose which their exhausted natures demanded.
The religion of Christ is ever merciful,
and ever consistent in its benevolence. It
is thoughtful of the benefactor as well as the
recipient. It requires of us all labor and self-sacrifice,
but to these it affixes a limit. It
never commands us to ruin our health and
enfeeble our minds by unnatural exhaustion.
It teaches us to obey the laws of our physical
organization, and to prepare ourselves for the
labors of to-morrow by the judiciously conducted
labors of to-day. It was on this principle
that our Lord conducted His intercourse
with His disciples. "He knew their
frame, and remembered that they were dust."</p>

<p>May we not from this incident derive a
lesson of practical instruction? I well know
that there are persons who are always sparing
themselves, who, while it is difficult to tell
what they do, are always complaining of the
crushing weight of their labors, and who are
rather exhausted with the dread of what they
shall do, than with the experience of what
they have actually done. It is not of those
that we speak. Those who do not labor have
no need of rest. It is to the honest, the painstaking,
the laborious, that we address the example
in the text. We sometimes meet with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
the industrious, self-denying servant of
Christ, in feeble health, and with an exhausted
nature, bemoaning his condition, and
condemning himself because he can accomplish
no more, while so much yet remains to
be done. To such a one we may safely present
the example of the blessed Savior. When
His apostles had done to the utmost of their
strength, altho the harvest was great, and
the laborers few, He did not urge upon them
additional labor, nor tell them that because
there was so much to be done they must never
cease from doing. No; He tells them to turn
aside and rest for a while. It is as tho
He had said, "Your strength is exhausted;
you cannot be qualified for subsequent duty
until you be refreshed. Economize, then,
your power, that you may accomplish the
more." The Savior addresses the same language
to us now. When we are worn down
in His service, as in any other, He would have
us rest, not for the sake of self-indulgence, but
that we may be the better prepared for future
effort. We do nothing at variance with
His will, when we, with a good conscience, use
the liberty which he has thus conceded to us.</p>

<p>Jesus, with His disciples, crossed the water,
and entered the desert; that is, the sparsely
inhabited country of Bethsaida. Desert, or
wilderness, in the New Testament, does not
mean an arid waste, but pasture land, forest,
or any district to which one could retire for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
seclusion. Here, in the cool and tranquil
neighborhood of the lake, he began to instruct
His disciples, and, without interruption,
make known to them the mysteries of
the kingdom. It was one of those seasons
that the Savior Himself rarely enjoyed.
Everything tended to repose: the rustling
leaves, the rippling waves, the song of the
birds, heard more distinctly in this rural solitude,
all served to calm the spirit ruffled by
the agitations of the world, and prepared it to
listen to the truths which unveil to us eternity.
Here our Lord could unbosom Himself,
without reserve, to His chosen few, and
hold with them that communion which He
was rarely permitted to enjoy during His
ministry on earth.</p>

<p>Soon, however, the whole scene is changed.
The multitude, whom he had so recently left,
having observed the direction in which He
had gone, have discovered the place of His
retreat. An immense crowd approaches, and
the little company is surrounded by a dense
mass of human beings pressing upon them on
every side. These are, however, only the
pioneers. At last, five thousand men, besides
women and children, are beheld thronging
around them.</p>

<p>Some of these suitors present most importunate
claims. They are in search of cure for
diseases which have baffled the skill of the
medical profession, and, as a last resort, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
have come to the Messiah for aid. Here was
a parent bringing a consumptive child. There
were children bearing on a couch a paralytic
parent. Here was a sister leading a brother
blind from his birth, while her supplications
were drowned by the shout of a frenzied lunatic
who was standing by her side. Every one,
believing his own claim to be the most urgent,
prest forward with selfish importunity.
Each one, caring for no other than
himself, was striving to attain the front rank,
while those behind, disappointed, and fearing
to lose this important opportunity, were
eager to occupy the places of those more fortunate
than themselves. The necessary tumult
and disorder of such a scene you can better
imagine than I can describe.</p>

<p>This was, doubtless, by no means a welcome
interruption. The apostles needed the time
for rest; for they were worn out in the public
service. They wanted it for instruction; for
such opportunities of intercourse with Christ
were rare. But what did they do? Did our
Lord inform the multitude that this day was
set apart for their own refreshment and improvement,
and that they could not be interrupted?
As He beheld them approaching,
did He quietly take to His boat, and leave
them to go home disappointed? Did He plead
His own convenience, or His need of repose,
as any reason for not attending to the pressing
necessities of His fellow men?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>No, my brethren, very far from it. That
providence of God had brought these multitudes
before Him, and that same providence
forbade Him to send them away unblest.
He at once broke up the conference with His
disciples and addrest Himself to the work
before Him. His instructions were of inestimable
importance; but I doubt if even they
were as important as the example of deep
humility, exhaustless kindness, and affecting
compassion which He here exhibited. When
the Master places work before us which can
be done at no other time, our convenience must
yield to other men's necessities. "The Son of
Man came not to be ministered unto, but to
minister." You can imagine to yourself the
Savior rising from His seat, in the midst
of His disciples, and presenting Himself to
the approaching multitudes. His calm dignity
awes into silence this tumultuous gathering
of the people. Those who came out to
witness the tricks of an empiric, or listen to
the ravings of a fanatic, find themselves, unexpectedly,
in a presence that repels every
emotion but that of profound veneration. The
light-hearted and frivolous are awestruck by
the unearthly majesty that seems to clothe
the Messiah as with a garment. And yet it
was a majesty that shone forth conspicuous,
most of all, by the manifestation of unparalleled
goodness. Every eye that met the eye
of the Savior quailed before Him; for it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
looked into a soul that had never sinned; and
the spirit of the sinner felt, for the first time,
the full power of immaculate virtue.</p>

<p>Thus the Savior passed among the crowd,
and "healed all that had need of healing."
The lame walked, the lepers were cleansed,
the blind received their sight, the paralytic
were restored to soundness, and the bloom
of health revisited the cheeks of those that
but just now were sick unto death.</p>

<p>The work to be done for the bodies of men
was accomplished, and there yet remained
some hours of the summer's day unconsumed.
The power and goodness displayed in this
miraculous healing would naturally predispose
the people to listen to the instructions
of the Savior. This was too valuable an
opportunity to be lost. Our Lord therefore
proceeded to speak to them of the things concerning
the kingdom of God. We can seem
to perceive the Savior seeking an eminence
from whence He could the more conveniently
address this vast assembly. You hear Him
unfold the laws of God's moral government.
He unmasks the hypocrisy of the Pharisees;
He rebukes the infidelity of the Sadducees;
He exposes the folly of the frivolous, as well
as of the selfish worldling; He speaks peaceably
to the humble penitent; He encourages
the meek, and comforts those that be cast
down. The intellect and the conscience of
this vast assembly are swayed at His will.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
The soul of man bows down in reverence in
the presence of its Creator. "He stilleth the
noise of the seas, the noise of their waves,
and the tumult of the people." As He closes
His address, every eye is moistened with compunction
for sin. Every soul cherishes the
hope of amendment. Every one is conscious
that a new moral light has dawned upon his
soul, and that a new moral universe has been
unveiled to his spiritual vision. As the closing
words of the Savior fell upon their ears,
the whole multitude stood for a while unmoved,
as tho transfixt to the earth by some
mighty spell; until, at last, the murmur is
heard from thousands of voices, "Never man
spake like this man."</p>

<p>But the shades of evening are gathering
around them. The multitude have nothing
to eat. To send them away fasting would be
inhuman, for divers of them came from far,
and many were women and children, who
could not perform their journey homeward
without previous refreshment. To purchase
food in the surrounding towns and villages
would be difficult; but even were this possible,
whence could the necessary funds be provided?
A famishing multitude was thus unexpectedly
cast upon the bounty of our Lord.
He had not tempted God by leading them
into the wilderness. They came to Him of
themselves, to hear His words and to be
healed of their infirmities. He could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
"send them away fasting, lest they should
faint by the way." In this dilemma, what
was to be done? He puts this question to
His disciples, and they can suggest no means
of relief. The little stock of provisions which
they had brought with them was barely sufficient
for themselves. They can perceive no
means whatever by which the multitude can
be fed, and they at once confess it.</p>

<p>The Savior, however, commands the twelve
to give them to eat. They produce their slender
store of provisions, amounting to five
loaves and two small fishes. He commands the
multitude to sit down by companies on the
grass. As soon as silence is obtained, He lifts
up His eyes to heaven, and supplicates the
blessing of God upon their scanty meal. He
begins to break the loaves and fishes, and distribute
them to His disciples, and His disciples
distribute them to the multitude. He
continues to break and distribute. Basket
after basket is filled and emptied, yet the supply
is undiminished. Food is carried in
abundance to the famishing thousands. Company
after company is supplied with food,
but the five loaves and two fishes remain unexhausted.
At last, the baskets are returned
full, and it is announced that the wants of
the multitude are supplied. The miracle then
ceases, and the multiplication of food is at
an end.</p>

<p>But even here the provident care of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Savior is manifested. Altho this food has
been so easily provided, it is not right that
it be lightly suffered to perish. Christ wrought
no miracles for the sake of teaching men
wastefulness. That food, by what means soever
provided, was a creature of God, and it
were sin to allow it to decay without accomplishing
the purposes for which it was created.
"Gather up the fragments," said the Master
of the feast, "that nothing be lost." "And
they gathered up the fragments that remained,
twelve baskets full."</p>

<p>Dissimilar as are our circumstances to those
of our Lord, we may learn from this latter
incident a lesson of instruction.</p>

<p>In the first place, as I have remarked, the
Savior did not lead the multitude into the
wilderness without making provision for their
sustenance. This would have been presumption.
They followed Him without His command,
and He found Himself with them in
this necessity. He had provided for His own
wants, but they had not provided for theirs.
The providence of God had, however, placed
Him in His present circumstances, and He
might therefore properly look to providence
for deliverance. This event, then, furnishes
the rule by which we are to be governed.
When we plunge ourselves into difficulty, by
a neglect of the means or by a misuse of the
faculties which God has bestowed upon us,
it is to be expected that He will leave us to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
our own devices. But when, in the honest discharge
of our duties, we find ourselves in circumstances
beyond the reach of human aid,
we may then confidently look up to God for
deliverance. He will always take care of us
while we are in the spot where He has placed
us. When He appoints for us trials, He also
appoints for us the means of escape. The path
of duty, tho it may seem arduous, is ever
the path of safety. We can more easily maintain
ourselves in the most difficult position,
God being our helper, than in apparent security
relying on our own strength.</p>

<p>The Savior, in full reliance upon God, with
only five loaves and two fishes, commenced the
distribution of food amongst the vast multitude.
Tho His whole store was barely sufficient
to supply the wants of His immediate
family, He began to share it with the thousands
who surrounded Him. Small as was
His provision at the commencement, it remained
unconsumed until the deed of mercy
was done, and the wants of the famished host
supplied. Nor were the disciples losers by
this act of charity. After the multitude had
eaten and were satisfied, twelve baskets full
of fragments remained, a reward for their
deed of benevolence.</p>

<p>From this portion of the narrative, we may,
I think, learn that if we act in faith, and in
the spirit of Christian love, we may frequently
be justified in commencing the most important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
good work, even when in possession of apparently
inadequate means. If the work be of
God, He will furnish us with helpers as fast
as they are needed. In all ages, God has rewarded
abundantly simple trust in Him, and
has bestowed upon it in the highest honor.
We must, however, remember the conditions
upon which alone we may expect His aid, lest
we be led into fanaticism. The service which
we undertake must be such as God has commanded,
and His providence must either designate
us for the work, or, at least, open
the door by which we shall enter upon it. It
must be God's work, and not our own; for the
good of others, and not for the gratification
of our own passions; and, in the doing of it,
we must, first of all, make sacrifice of ourselves,
and not of others. Under such circumstances,
there is hardly a good design which
we may not undertake with cheerful hopes of
success, for God has promised us His assistance.
"If God be for us, who can be against
us?" The calculations of the men of this
world are of small account in such a matter.
It would have provoked the smile of an infidel
to behold the Savior commencing the work of
feeding five thousand men with a handful of
provisions. But the supply increased as fast
as it was needed, and it ceased not until all
that He had prayed for was accomplished.</p>

<p>Perhaps, also, we may learn from this incident
another lesson. If I mistake not, it suggests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
to us that in works of benevolence we
are accustomed to rely too much on human,
and too little on divine, aid. When we attempt
to do good, we commence by forming
large associations, and suppose that our success
depends upon the number of men whom
we can unite in the promotion of our undertaking.
Every one is apt thus to forget his
own personal duty, and rely upon the labor
of others, and it is well if he does not put
his organization in the place of God Himself.
Would it not be better if we made benevolence
much more a matter between God and our
own souls, each one doing with his own hands,
in firm reliance on divine aid, the work which
Providence has placed directly before him?
Our Lord did not send to the villages round to
organize a general effort to relieve the famishing.
In reliance upon God, He set about to
work Himself, with just such means as God had
afforded Him. All the miracles of benevolence
have, if I mistake not, been wrought in
the same manner. The little band of disciples
in Jerusalem accomplished more for the conversion
of the world than all the Christians
of the present day united. And why? Because
every individual Christian felt that the
conversion of the world was a work for which
he himself, and not an abstraction that he
called the Church, was responsible. Instead of
relying on man for aid, every one looked up
directly to God, and went forth to the work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
God was thus exalted, the power was confest
to be His own, and, in a few years, the standard
of the Cross was carried to the remotest
extremities of the then known world.</p>

<p>Such has, I think, been the case ever since.
Every great moral reformation has proceeded
upon principles analogous of these. It was
Luther, standing up alone in simple reliance
upon God, that smote the Papal hierarchy;
and the effects of that blow are now agitating
the nations of Europe. Roger Williams, amid
persecution and banishment, held forth that
doctrine of soul-liberty which, in its onward
march, is disenthralling a world. Howard,
alone, undertook the work of showing mercy
to the prisoner, and his example is now enlisting
the choicest minds in Christendom in
this labor of benevolence. Clarkson, unaided,
a young man, and without influences, consecrated
himself to the work of abolishing the
slave trade; and, before he rested from his
labor, his country had repented of and forsaken
this atrocious sin. Raikes saw the children
of Gloucester profaning the Sabbath
day; he set on foot a Sabbath school on his
own account, and now millions of children are
reaping the benefit of his labors, and his example
has turned the attention of the whole
world to the religious instruction of the young.
With such facts before us, we surely should
be encouraged to attempt individually the accomplishment
of some good design, relying in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
humility and faith upon Him who is able to
grant prosperity to the feeblest effort put
forth in earnest reliance on His almightiness.</p>

<p>Such were the occupations that filled up a
day in the life of Jesus of Nazareth. There
was not an act done for Himself; all was done
for others. Every hour was employed in the
labor which that hour set before Him. Private
kindness, the relief of distress, public
teaching, and ministration to the wants of
the famishing, filled up the entire day. Let
His disciples learn to follow His example.
Let us, like Him, forget ourselves, our own
wants, and our own weariness, that we may,
as he did, scatter blessings on every side, as
we move onward in the pathway of our daily
life. If such were the occupations of the Son
of God, can we do more wisely than to imitate
His example? Every disciple would then
be as a city set upon a hill, and men, seeing
our good works, would glorify our Father who
is in heaven. "Then would our righteousness
go forth as brightness, and our salvation as a
lamp that burneth."</p>

<h4>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">Alexander Vinet</span>, the eminent Swiss
divine and author, was born at Ouchy,
Canton, in 1797. He was professor of
theology at Lausanne (1837-45), where
he gained reputation as a preacher, a
philosopher, and a writer. He was
tolerant tho critical, and many of his
utterances are marked by rare brilliancy.
His supreme and intense faith led him
to say: "The gospel is believed when it
has ceased to be to us an external and has
become an internal truth, when it has
become a fact in our consciousness.
Christianity is conscience raised to its
highest exercise." He died in 1847.</p>

<h2>VINET</h2>

<h3>1797-1847</h3>

<h4>THE MYSTERIES OF CHRISTIANITY</h4>

<p><em>Things which have not entered into the heart of man.</em>&mdash;1
Cor. ii., 9.</p>


<p>"I do not comprehend, therefore I do not
believe." "The gospel is full of
mysteries, therefore I do not receive
the gospel:"&mdash;such is one of the favorite
arguments of infidelity. To see how much is
made of this, and what confidence it inspires,
we might believe it solid, or, at least,
specious; but it is neither the one nor the
other; it will not bear the slightest attention,
the most superficial examination of reason;
and if it still enjoys some favor in the world,
this is but a proof of the lightness of our
judgments upon things worthy of our most
serious attention.</p>

<p>Upon what, in fact, does this argument
rest? Upon the claim of comprehending
every thing in the religion which God has
offered or could offer us&mdash;a claim equally unjust,
unreasonable, useless. This we proceed
to develop.</p>

<p>1. In the first place, it is an unjust claim.
It is to demand of God what He does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
owe us. To prove this, let us suppose that
God has given a religion to man, and let us
further suppose that religion to be the gospel:
for this absolutely changes nothing to the
argument. We may believe that God was
free, at least, with reference to us, to give us
or not to give us a religion; but it must be
admitted that in granting it He contracts
engagements to us, and that the first favor
lays Him under a necessity of conferring
other favors. For this is merely to say that
God must be consistent, and that He finishes
what He has begun. Since it is by a written
revelation He manifests His designs respecting
us, it is necessary He should fortify that
revelation by all the authority which would
at least determine us to receive it; it is necessary
He should give us the means of judging
whether the men who speak to us in His name
are really sent by Him; in a word, it is
necessary we should be assured that the Bible
is truly the Word of God.</p>

<p>It would not indeed be necessary that the
conviction of each of us should be gained by
the same kind of evidence. Some shall be
led to Christianity by the historical or external
arguments; they shall prove to themselves
the truth of the Bible as the truth of
all history is proved; they shall satisfy themselves
that the books of which it is composed
are certainly those of the times and of the
authors to which they are ascribed. This settled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
they shall compare the prophecies contained
in these ancient documents with the
events that have happened in subsequent
ages; they shall assure themselves of the reality
of the miraculous facts related in these
books, and shall thence infer the necessary
intervention of divine power, which alone
disposes the forces of nature, and can alone
interrupt or modify their action. Others, less
fitted for such investigations, shall be struck
with the internal evidence of the Holy Scriptures.
Finding there the state of their souls
perfectly described, their wants fully exprest,
and the true remedies for their maladies
completely indicated; struck with a character
of truth and candor which nothing can
imitate; in fine, feeling themselves in their
inner nature moved, changed, renovated, by
the mysterious influence of these holy writings,
they shall acquire, by such means, a conviction
of which they can not always give an
account to others, but which is not the less
legitimate, irresistible, and immovable. Such
is the double road by which an entrance is
gained into the asylum of faith. But it was
due from the wisdom of God, from His justice,
and, we venture to say it, from the honor of
His government, that He should open to man
this double road; for, if He desired man to be
saved by knowledge, on the same principle
He engaged Himself to furnish him the means
of knowledge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>Behold, whence come the obligations of the
Deity with reference to us, which obligations
He has fulfilled. Enter on this double method
of proof. Interrogate history, time and
places, respecting the authenticity of the
Scriptures; grasp all the difficulties, sound all
the objections; do not permit yourselves to be
too easily convinced; be the more severe upon
that book, as it professes to contain the sovereign
rule of your life, and the disposal of
your destiny; you are permitted to do this,
nay, you are encouraged to do it, provided you
proceed to the investigation with the requisite
capacities and with pure intentions. Or, if
you prefer another method, examine, with an
honest heart, the contents of the Scriptures;
inquire, while you run over the words of
Jesus, if ever man spake like this Man; inquire
if the wants of your soul, long deceived,
and the anxieties of your spirit, long cherished
in vain, do not, in the teaching and work of
Christ, find that satisfaction and repose which
no wisdom was ever able to procure you;
breathe, if I may thus express myself, that
perfume of truth, of candor and purity, which
exhales from every page of the gospel; see,
if, in all these respects, it does not bear the
undeniable seal of inspiration and divinity.
Finally, test it, and if the gospel produces
upon you a contrary effect, return to the
books and the wisdom of men, and ask of them
what Christ has not been able to give you.</p>

<p>But if, neglecting these two ways, made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
accessible to you, and trodden by the feet of
ages, you desire, before all, that the Christian
religion should, in every point, render itself
comprehensible to your mind, and complacently
strip itself of all mysteries; if you wish
to penetrate beyond the veil, to find there, not
the aliment which gives life to the soul, but
that which would gratify your restless curiosity,
I maintain that you raise against God
a claim the most indiscreet, the most rash and
unjust; for He has never engaged, either
tacitly or expressly, to discover to you the
secret which your eye craves; and such
audacious importunity is fit to excite His indignation.
He has given you what He owed
you, more indeed than He owed you; the rest
is with Himself.</p>

<p>If a claim so unjust could be admitted,
where, I ask you, would be the limit of your
demands? Already you require more from
God than He has accorded to angels; for these
eternal mysteries which trouble you, the harmony
of the divine prescience with human
freedom, the origin of evil and its ineffable
remedy, the incarnation of the eternal Word&mdash;the
relations of the God-man with His Father&mdash;the
atoning virtue of His sacrifice, the regenerating
efficacy of the Spirit-comforter, all
these things are secrets, the knowledge of
which is hidden from angels themselves, who,
according to the word of the Apostle, stoop
to explore their depths, and can not.</p>

<p>If you reproach the Eternal for having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
kept the knowledge of these divine mysteries
to Himself, why do you not reproach Him for
the thousand other limits He has prescribed
for you? Why not reproach Him for
not having given you wings like a bird, to
visit the regions, which, till now, have been
scanned only by your eyes? Why not reproach
Him for not giving you, besides the
five senses with which you are provided, ten
other senses which He has perhaps granted
to other creatures, and which procure for
them perceptions of which you have no idea?
Why not, in fine, reproach Him for having
caused the darkness of night to succeed the
brightness of day invariably on the earth?
Ah! you do not reproach Him for that. You
love that night which brings rest to so many
fatigued bodies and weary spirits; which
suspends in so many wretches, the feeling of
grief; that night, during which orphans,
slaves, and criminals cease to be, because over
all their misfortunes and sufferings it spreads,
with the opiate of sleep, the thick veil of
oblivion; you love that night which, peopling
the deserts of the heavens with ten thousand
stars, not known to the day, reveals the
infinite to our ravished imagination.</p>

<p>Well, then, why do you not, for a similar
reason, love the night of divine mysteries,
night, gracious and salutary, in which reason
humbles itself, and finds refreshment and
repose; where the darkness even is a revelation;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
where one of the principal attributes of
God, immensity, discovers itself much more
fully to our mind; where, in fine, the tender
relations He has permitted us to form with
Himself, are guarded from all admixture of
familiarity by the thought that the Being who
has humbled Himself to us, is, at the same
time, the inconceivable God who reigns before
all time, who includes in Himself all existences
and all conditions of existence, the center of
all thought, the law of all law, the supreme
and final reason of every thing! So that, if
you are just, instead of reproaching Him for
the secrets of religion, you will bless Him that
He has enveloped you in mysteries.</p>

<p>2. But this claim is not only unjust toward
God; it is also in itself exceedingly unreasonable.</p>

<p>What is religion? It is God putting Himself
in communication with man; the Creator
with the creature, the infinite with the finite.
There already, without going further, is a
mystery; a mystery common to all religions,
impenetrable in all religions. If, then, every
thing which is a mystery offends you, you are
arrested on the threshold, I will not say of
Christianity, but of every religion; I say, even
of that religion which is called natural, because
it rejects revelation and miracles; for it
necessarily implies, at the very least, a connection,
a communication of some sort between
God and man&mdash;the contrary being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
equivalent to atheism. Your claim prevents
you from having any belief; and because you
have not been willing to be Christians, it will
not allow you to be deists.</p>

<p>"It is of no consequence," you say, "we
pass over that difficulty; we suppose between
God and us connections we can not conceive;
we admit them because they are necessary to
us. But this is the only step we are willing to
take: we have already yielded too much to
yield more." Say more, say you have granted
too much not to grant much more, not to
grant all! You have consented to admit, without
comprehending it, that there may be communications
from God to you, and from you
to God. But consider well what is implied in
such a supposition. It implies that you are
dependent, and yet free: this you do not comprehend;
it implies that the Spirit of God
can make itself understood by your spirit: this
you do not comprehend; it implies that your
prayers may exert an influence on the will of
God: this you do not comprehend. It is necessary
you should receive all these mysteries,
in order to establish with God connections the
most vague and superficial, and by the very
side of which atheism is placed. And when,
by a powerful effort with yourselves you have
done so much as to admit these mysteries, you
recoil from those of Christianity! You have
accepted the foundation, and refuse the superstructure!
You have accepted the principle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
and refuse the details! You are right, no
doubt, so soon as it is proved to you, that the
religion which contains these mysteries does
not come from God; or rather, that these
mysteries contain contradictory ideas. But
you are not justified in denying them, for the
sole reason that you do not understand them;
and the reception you have given to the first
kind of mysteries compels you, by the same
rule, to receive the others.</p>

<p>This is not all. Not only are mysteries an
inseparable part, nay, the very substance of
all religion, but it is absolutely impossible that
a true religion should not present a great
number of mysteries. If it is true, it ought
to teach more truths respecting God and
divine things than any other, than all others
together; but each of these truths has a relation
to the infinite, and by consequence borders
on a mystery. How should it be otherwise
in religion, when it is thus in nature
itself? Behold God in nature! The more He
gives us to contemplate, the more He gives to
astonish us. To each creature is attached
some mystery. A grain of sand is an abyss!
Now, if the manifestations which God has
made of Himself in nature suggest to the
observer a thousand questions which can not
be answered, how will it be, when to that
first revelation, another is added; when God
the Creator and Preserver reveals Himself
under new aspects as God the Reconciler and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Savior? Shall not mysteries multiply with
discoveries? With each new day shall we not
see associated a new night? And shall we not
purchase each increase of knowledge with an
increase of ignorance? Has not the doctrine
of grace, so necessary, so consoling, alone
opened a profound abyss, into which, for
eighteen centuries, rash and restless spirits
have been constantly plunging?</p>

<p>It is, then, clearly necessary that Christianity
should, more than any other religion,
be mysterious, simply because it is true. Like
mountains, which, the higher they are, cast
the larger shadows, the gospel is the more
obscure and mysterious on account of its
sublimity. After this, will you be indignant
that you do not comprehend every thing in the
gospel? It would, forsooth, be a truly surprising
thing if the ocean could not be held
in the hollow of your hand, or uncreated
wisdom within the limits of your intelligence!
It would be truly unfortunate if a finite being
could not embrace the infinite, and that, in the
vast assemblage of things there should be some
idea beyond its grasp! In other words, it
would be truly unfortunate if God Himself
should know something which man does not
know!</p>

<p>Let us acknowledge, then, how insensate is
such a claim when it is made with reference
to religion.</p>

<p>But let us also recollect how much, in making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
such a claim, we shall be in opposition to
ourselves; for the submission we dislike in
religion, we cherish in a thousand other things.
It happens to us every day to admit things
we do not understand, and to do so without
the least repugnance. The things, the knowledge
of which is refused us, are much more
numerous than we perhaps think. Few diamonds
are perfectly pure; still fewer truths
are perfectly clear. The union of our soul
with our body is a mystery&mdash;our most familiar
emotions and affections are a mystery&mdash;the
action of thought and of will is a mystery&mdash;our
very existence is a mystery. Why do we
admit these various facts? Is it because we
understand them? No, certainly, but because
they are self-evident, and because they are
truths by which we live. In religion we have
no other course to take. We ought to know
whether it is true and necessary; and once
convinced of these two points, we ought, like
the angels, to submit to the necessity of being
ignorant of some things. And why do we not
submit cheerfully to a privation which, after
all, is not one?</p>

<p>3. To desire the knowledge of mysteries is
to desire what is utterly useless; it is to raise,
as I have said before, a claim the most vain
and idle. What in reference to us is the
object of the gospel? Evidently to regenerate
and save us. But it attains this end wholly
by the things it reveals. Of what use would it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
be to know those it conceals from us? We
possess the knowledge which can enlighten
our consciences, rectify our inclinations, renew
our hearts; what should we gain if we possest
other knowledge? It infinitely concerns
us to know that the Bible is the Word of God;
does it equally concern us to know in what
way the holy men that wrote it were moved
by the Holy Ghost? It is of infinite moment
to us to know that Jesus Christ is the Son of
God; need we know precisely in what way the
divine and human natures are united in His
adorable person? It is of infinite importance
for us to know that unless we are born again
we can not enter the kingdom of God, and
that the Holy Spirit is the author of the new
birth; shall we be further advanced if we know
the divine process by which that wonder is
performed? Is it not enough for us to know
the truths that save? Of what use, then,
would it be to know those which have not
the slightest bearing on our salvation? "Tho
I know all mysteries," says St. Paul, "and
have not charity, I am nothing." St. Paul
was content not to know, provided he had
charity; shall not we, following his example,
be content also without knowledge, provided
that, like him, we have charity, that is to say,
life?</p>

<p>But some one will say "If the knowledge of
mysteries is really without influence on our
salvation, why have they been indicated to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
us at all?" What if it should be to teach us
not to be too prodigal of our "wherefores!" if
it should be to serve as an exercise of our
faith, a test of our submission! But we will
not stop with such a reply.</p>

<p>Observe, I pray you, in what manner the
mysteries of which you complain have taken
their part in religion. You readily perceive
they are not by themselves, but associated
with truths which have a direct bearing on
your salvation. They contain them, they
serve to develop them; but they are not themselves
the truths that save. It is with these
mysteries as it is with the vessel that contains
a medicinal draft&mdash;it is not the vessel that
cures, but the draft; yet the draft could not
be presented without the vessel. Thus each
truth that saves is contained in a mystery,
which, in itself, has no power to save. So the
great work of expiation is necessarily attached
to the incarnation of the Son of God, which is
a mystery; so the sanctifying graces of the
new covenant are necessarily connected with
the effluence of the Holy Spirit, which is a
mystery; so, too, the divinity of religion finds
a seal and an attestation in the miracles,
which are mysteries. Everywhere the light
is born from darkness, and darkness accompanies
the light. These two orders of truths
are so united, so interlinked, that you can not
remove the one without the other, and each of
the mysteries you attempt to tear from religion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
would carry with it one of the truths
which bear directly on your regeneration and
salvation. Accept the mysteries, then, not as
truths that can save you, but as the necessary
conditions of the merciful work of the Lord
in your behalf.</p>

<p>The true point at issue in reference to
religion is this:&mdash;Does the religion which is
proposed to us change the heart, unite to
God, prepare for heaven? If Christianity produces
these effects, we will leave the enemies
of the cross free to revolt against its mysteries,
and tax them with absurdity. The gospel, we
will say to them, is then an absurdity; you
have discovered it. But behold what a new
species of absurdity that certainly is which
attaches man to all his duties, regulates
human life better than all the doctrines of
sages, plants in his bosom harmony, order,
and peace, causes him joyfully to fulfil all
the offices of civil life, renders him better
fitted to live, better fitted to die, and which,
were it generally received, would be the support
and safeguard of society! Cite to us,
among all human absurdities, a single one
which produces such effects. If that "foolishness"
we preach produces effects like these,
is it not natural to conclude that it is truth
itself? And if these things have not entered
the heart of man, it is not because they are
absurd, but because they are divine.</p>

<p>Make but a single reflection. You are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
obliged to confess that none of the religions
which man may invent can satisfy his wants,
or save his soul. Thereupon you have a
choice to make. You will either reject them
all as insufficient and false, and seek for
nothing better, since man can not invent better,
and then you will abandon to chance, to
caprice of temperament or of opinion, your
moral life and future destiny; or you will
adopt that other religion which some treat as
folly, and it will render you holy and pure,
blameless in the midst of a perverse generation,
united to God by love, and to your
brethren by charity, indefatigable in doing
good, happy in life, happy in death. Suppose,
after all this, you shall be told that this
religion is false; but meanwhile, it has restored
in you the image of God, reestablished
your primitive connections with that great
Being, and put you in a condition to enjoy life
and the happiness of heaven. By means of it
you have become such that at the last day, it
is impossible that God should not receive you
as His children and make you partakers of
His glory. You are made fit for paradise,
nay, paradise has commenced for you even
here, because you love. This religion has done
for you what all religions propose, and what
no other has realized. Nevertheless, by the
supposition, it is false! And what more could
it do, were it true? Rather do you not see that
this is a splendid proof of its truth? Do you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
not see that it is impossible that a religion
which leads to God should not come from
God, and that the absurdity is precisely that
of supposing that you can be regenerated by a
falsehood?</p>

<p>Suppose that afterward, as at the first, you
do not comprehend. It seems necessary, then,
you should be saved by the things you do not
comprehend. Is that a misfortune? Are you
the less saved? Does it become you to demand
from God an explanation of an obscurity
which does not injure you, when, with reference
to every thing essential, He has been
prodigal of light? The first disciples of Jesus,
men without culture and learning, received
truths which they did not comprehend, and
spread them through the world. A crowd of
sages and men of genius have received, from
the hands of these poor people, truths which
they comprehended no more than they. The
ignorance of the one, and the science of the
other, have been equally docile. Do, then,
as the ignorant and the wise have done.
Embrace with affection those truths which
have never entered into your heart, and which
will save you. Do not lose, in vain discussions,
the time which is gliding away, and
which is bearing you into the cheering or
appalling light of eternity. Hasten to be
saved. Love now; one day you will know.
May the Lord Jesus prepare you for that
period of light, of repose, and of happiness!</p>

<h4>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">John Summerfield</span> was born in England
in 1798, and came to New York in 1821,
where he soon became one of the most
popular and eloquent preachers of that
day. He belonged to the Methodist Communion
and his name is still perpetuated
in the names of many Methodist churches.
He was unusually simple and modest
in his tastes and habits, but when he
spoke from the pulpit he produced a great
impression by the force and daring of
his style. He gave promise of equaling
Whitefield as a pulpit orator, but he was
subject to delicate health and prematurely
died in 1825, twenty-seven years of age.</p>

<h2>SUMMERFIELD</h2>

<h3>1798-1825</h3>

<h4>THE HEAVENLY INHERITANCE</h4>

<p><em>For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly
into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and
Saviour Jesus Christ.</em>&mdash;2 Peter i., 11.</p>


<p>Of all the causes which may be adduced
to account for the indifference which
is so generally manifested toward
those great concerns of eternity, in which men
are so awfully interested, none appears to
me so likely to resolve the mystery, as that unbelief
which lies at the core of every heart,
hindering repentance, and so making faith
impossible. Men hear that there is a hell to
shun, a heaven to win; and, though they give
their assent to both these truths, they never
impress them on their mind. It is plain that,
whatever their lips may confess, they never
believed with the heart, otherwise some effect
would have been produced in the life. The
germ of unbelief lies within, and discovers itself
in all that indifference which is displayed,
in the majority of that class of beings whose
existence is to be perpetuated throughout eternity.
If these thoughts do sometimes obtrude
themselves on their serious attention, they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
immediately banished from their minds; and
the dying exclamation of Moses may be taken
up with tears by every lover of perishing sinners:
"O! that they were wise, that they
understood this, that they would consider
their latter end!" When God, by His prophet
Isaiah, called the Israelites to a sense of their
awful departure from Him, His language was,
"My people do not know: My people do not
consider." How few are there like Mary, who
"ponder those things in their heart," who
are willing to look at themselves, to pry into
eternity, to put the question home,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Shall I be with the damn'd cast out,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Or numbered with the bless'd?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">This question must sooner or later have a
place in your minds, or awful will be your
state indeed; let it reach your hearts to-day;
and if you pray to the Father of light, you
will soon be enabled in His light to discern
so much of yourselves as will cause you to
cry, "What shall I do to be saved?" While
we shall this morning attempt to point out
some of the privileges of the sons of God, oh!
may your hearts catch the strong desire to
be conformed to the living Head, that so an
abundant entrance may be administered unto
you also, into the everlasting kingdom of our
Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>The privilege to which our text leads us, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
exclusively applicable to those to whom that
question has been solved by the Spirit of God;
those who have believed to the saving of their
souls; who have experienced redemption
through His blood, and the forgiveness of sins;
and who are walking in the fear of the Lord
and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>I. The state to which we look forward: the
"everlasting kingdom of our Lord and
Savior."</p>

<p>1. It is a kingdom. By this figurative expression
our Lord has described the state of
grace here and of glory hereafter; our happiness
in time and our happiness in eternity.
They were wisely so called: Jesus has said, as
well as done, all things well; for these two
states differ not in kind, but in degree; the
one is merely a preparative for the other, and
he who has been a subject of the former kingdom
will be a subject of the latter. Grace is
but the seed of glory, glory is the maturity
of grace; grace is but the bud of glory, glory
is grace full blown; grace is but the blossom
of glory, glory is the ripe fruit of grace; grace
is but the infant of glory, glory is the perfection
of grace. Hence our hymn beautifully
says, "The men of grace have found glory
begun below," agreeing with our Lord's own
words, "He that believeth hath everlasting
life"; he feels even here its glories beginning&mdash;a
foretaste of its bliss.</p>

<p>Now the propriety with which these two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
states are called kingdoms is manifest from
the analogy which might be traced between
them and the model of a human sovereignty.
Two or three of the outlines of this model will
be sufficient.</p>

<p>In the idea of a kingdom it is implied that
in some part of its extent there is the residence
of a sovereign; for this is essential to
constitute it. Now in the kingdom of grace
the heart of the believer is made the residence
of the King invisible! "Know ye not that
your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost
which is in you?" Such know what that promise
means, "I will dwell in them, and they
shall be my people." St. Paul exultingly
cries, "Christ liveth in me."</p>

<p>Again, it is essential that the inhabitants of
a kingdom be under the government of its
laws. An empire without laws is no sovereignty
at all; it ceases to be such, for every
inhabitant has an equal right to do that which
seems good in his own eyes. Now the subjects
of Christ's kingdom of grace are "not without
law, but are under a law to Christ"; they
do His righteous will!</p>

<p>Lastly, it is essential that the subjects of a
kingdom be under the protection of the presiding
monarch, and that they repose their
confidence in him. To the subjects of the
kingdom of grace, Christ imparts His kingly
protection; this is their heritage: "No weapon
formed against them shall prosper"; nay, He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
imparts to them of His royal bounty, and they
enjoy all the blessings of an inward heaven.</p>

<p>But how great the perfection of the kingdom
of glory mentioned in our text! Does
He make these vile bodies His residence here?
How much more glorious is His temple above!
how splendid the court of heaven! There, indeed,
he fixes His throne, and they see Him
as He is. Does He exercise His authority here
and rule His happy subjects by the law, the
perfect law of love? How much more in
heaven! He reigns there forever over them;
His government is there wholly by Himself;
He knows nothing of a rival there; His rule
is sole and perfect: there they serve Him day
and night. Are His subjects here partakers of
His kingly bounty? Much more in heaven!
He calls them to a participation of all the
joys, the spiritual joys which are at His right
hand, and the pleasures which are there forevermore.
Yet, after all our descriptions of
that glory, it is not yet revealed, and, therefore,
inconceivable. But who would not hail
such a Son of David? who would not desire to
be swayed by such a Prince of Peace? Whose
heart would not ascend with the affections of
our poet, "O! that with yonder sacred throng,
we at His feet may fall"?</p>

<p>2. But it is an everlasting kingdom! Here it
rises in the scale of comparison. Weigh the
kingdoms of this world in this balance, and
they are found wanting; for on many we read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
their fatal history, and ere long we shall see
them all branded with the writing of the invisible
Agent, "The kingdom is taken from
thee, and given to a nation bringing forth
the fruits thereof"; "For the kingdoms of
this world have become the kingdoms of our
Lord and of his Christ"; they will be absorbed
and swallowed up in the fulness of
eternity, and leave not a wrack behind!
Every thing here is perishable! The towering
diadem of Caesar has fallen from his head
and crumbled into dust; and that kingdom
whose scepter once swayed the world, betwixt
whose colossal stride all nations were glad to
creep to find themselves dishonored graves, is
now forgotten, or, if its recollection be preserved,
its history is emphatically called "The
Decline and Fall."</p>

<p>But bring the matter nearer home; apply
it not to multitudes of subjects, but to your
individual experience, and has not that good
teacher instructed you in this sad lesson?
We tremble to look at our earthly possessions
and employments, lest we should see them in
motion, spreading their wings to fly away!
How many are there already who, in talking
of their comforts, are obliged to go back in
their reckoning! Would not this be the language
of some of you: "I had&mdash;I had a husband,
the sharer of my joys, the soother of
my sorrows; but he is not! I had a wife, a
helpmeet for me; but where is she? I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
children to whom I looked up as my support
and staff in the decline of life, while passing
down the hill; but I am bereaved of my children!
I had health, and I highly prized its
wealth; but now my emaciated frame, my
shriveled system, and the pains of nature bespeak
that comfort fled! I had, or fondly
thought I had, happiness in possession! Then
I said with Job, 'I shall die in my nest!'
but ah! an unexpected blast passed over me,
and now my joys are blighted! 'They have
fled as a shadow, and continued not.'" Yes!
time promised you much! perhaps it performed
a little; but it can not do any thing
for you on which it can grave "eternal." Its
name is mortal, its nature is decay; it was
born with man, and when the generations of
men shall cease to exist, it will cease also:
"Time shall be no longer!" We know concerning
these that, "All flesh is as grass, and
all the glory of man as the flower of grass.
The grass withereth, and the flower fadeth,
but the word of the Lord endureth forever."
Yes! His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom;
glory can not corrupt! the crown of glory can
not fade! Why? Death will be destroyed;
Christ will put this last enemy under His
feet, and all will then be eternal life! Oh,
happy, happy kingdom; nay, thrice happy he
who shall be privileged to be its subject!</p>

<p>3. It is the everlasting kingdom of our own
Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. It is His by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
claim: "Him hath God the Father highly
exalted"; yea, Him hath He appointed to be
"the judge of quick and dead"; for tho
by the sufferings of death He was made a
little lower than the angels, yet immediately
after His resurrection He declares that now
"All power is given unto him in heaven and
in earth"! The Father hath committed all
judgment unto the Son, and He has now the
disposal of the offices and privileges of the
empire among His faithful followers. This
is the idea that the penitent dying thief had
on the subject: "Lord, remember me when
thou comest into thy kingdom"; and St.
Paul expresses the same when he says to Timothy
in the confidence of faith, "The Lord
shall deliver me and preserve me unto his
heavenly kingdom." Oh! how pleasing the
thought to the child of God, that his ruler to
all eternity will be his elder Brother; for He
who sanctifieth and they who are sanctified
are all of one; and though He is heir of all
things, yet we, as younger branches of the
same heavenly family, shall be joint heirs,
fellow-heirs of the same glorious inheritance.
How great will be our joy to behold Him who
humbled Himself for us to death, even the
death of the cross, now exalted God over all,
blest for evermore; and while contemplating
Him under the character of our Lord and
Savior Jesus Christ, how great the relish
which will be given to that feeling of the redeemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
which will constrain them to cry,
"Thou alone art worthy to receive glory, and
honor, and power."</p>

<p>II. But the apostle reminds us of the entrance
into this kingdom!</p>

<p>1. The entrance into this kingdom is death:
"By one man sin entered into the world, and
death by sin:"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Death, like a narrow sea, divides<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That heavenly land from ours!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">"A messenger is sent to bring us to God, but
it is the King of Terrors. We enter the land
flowing with milk and honey, but it is through
the valley of the shadow of death." Yet fear
not, O thou child of God! there is no need that
thou, through the fear of death, shouldst be
all thy lifetime subject to bondage.</p>

<p>2. No; hear the apostle: the entrance is
ministered unto thee! Death is but His minister;
he can not lock his ice-cold hand in thine
till He permit. Our Jesus has the keys of hell
and death; and till He liberates the vassal to
bring thee home, not a hair of thy head can
fall to the ground! Fear not, thou worm!
He who minds the sparrows appoints the time
for thy removal: fear not; only be thou always
ready, that, whenever the messenger
comes to take down the tabernacle in which
thy spirit has long made her abode, thou
mayest be able to exclaim, "Amen! even so,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
Lord Jesus, come quickly." Death need have
no terrors for thee; he is the vassal of thy
Lord, and, however unwilling to do Him reverence,
yet to Him that sits at God's right
hand shall even death pay, if not a joyful, yet
a trembling homage; nay, more:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"To Him shall earth and hell submit,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And every foe shall fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Till death expires beneath His feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And God is all in all."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Christ has already had one triumph over
death; His iron pangs could not detain the
Prince who has "life in himself"; and in
His strength thou shalt triumph, for the
power of Christ is promised to rest upon thee!
He has had the same entrance; His footsteps
marked the way, and His cry to thee is, "Follow
thou me." "My sheep," says He, "hear
my voice, and they do follow me"; they follow
Me gladly, even into this gloomy vale;
and what is the consequence? "They shall
never perish, neither shall any man pluck
them out of my hand."</p>

<p>3. It is ministered unto you abundantly.
Perhaps the apostle means that the death of
some is distinguished by indulgences and honors
not vouchsafed to all. In the experience
of some, the passage appears difficult; in others
it is comparatively easy; they gently fall
asleep in Jesus. But we not only see diversities
in the mortal agony&mdash;this would be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
small thing.... Some get in with sails
full spread and carrying a rich cargo indeed,
while others arrive barely on a single plank.
Some, who have long had their conversation
in heaven, are anxious to be wafted into the
celestial haven; while others, who never
sought God till alarmed at the speedy approach
of death, have little confidence,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And linger shivering on the brink,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And fear to launch away."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">This doctrine must have been peculiarly encouraging
to the early converts to whom St.
Peter wrote. From the tenor of both of his
epistles it is clear that they were in a state
of severe suffering, and in great danger of
apostatizing through fear of persecution. He
reminds them that if they hold fast their
professions, an abundant entrance will be administered
unto them. The death of the martyr
is far more glorious than that of the Christian
who concealed his profession through fear
of man. Witness the case of Stephen: he was
not ashamed of being a witness for Jesus in
the face of the violent death which awaited
him, and which crushed the tabernacle of his
devoted spirit; his Lord reserved the highest
display of His love and of His glory for that
awful hour! "Behold!" says he to his enemies,
while gnashing on him with their teeth,
"Behold! I see heaven opened, and the Son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
of man standing on the right hand of God";
then, in the full triumph of faith, he cries
out, "Lord Jesus! receive my spirit!"</p>

<p>But did these things apply merely to the
believers to whom St. Peter originally wrote?
No; you are the men to whom they equally
apply; according to your walk and profession
of that gospel will be the entrance which will
be ministered unto you. Some of you have
heard, in another of our houses, during the
past week, the dangerous tendency of the
spirit of fear, the fear of man. I would you
had all heard that discourse: alas! many who
have a name and a place among us are becoming
mere Sabbath-day worshipers in the
courts of the Lord, and lightly esteem the
daily means of grace. I believe this is one
cause at least why many are weak and sickly
among us in divine things. The inner man
does not make due increase; the world is stealing
a march unawares upon us. May God revive
among us the spirit of our fathers!</p>

<p>These things, then, I say, equally apply to
you. Behold the strait, the royal, the king's
highway! Are you afraid of the reproach of
Christ?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ashamed of Jesus, that dear Friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">On whom our hopes of heaven depend?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">How soon would the world be overcome if
all who profess that faith were faithful to it!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
Wo to the rebellious children who compromise
truth with the world, and in effect deny
their Lord and Master! Who hath required
this at their hands? Do they not follow with
the crowd who cry, "Lord, Lord! and yet do
not the things which He says"? Will they
have the adoption and the glory? Will they
aim at the honor implied in these words, "Ye
are my witnesses?" Will ye indeed be sons?
Then see the path wherein His footsteps
shine! The way is open! see that ye walk
therein! The false apostles, the deceitful
workers shall have their reward; the same
that those of old had, the praise and esteem
of men; while the faith of those who truly call
Him Father and Lord, and who walk in the
light as He is in the light, who submit, like
Him and His true followers, to be counted as
"the filth of the world, and the offscouring of
all things", shall be found unto praise, and
honor, and glory!</p>

<p>The true Christian does not seek to hide
himself in a corner; he lets his light shine before
men, whether they will receive it or not;
and thereby is his Father glorified. Having
thus served, by the will of God, the hour of
his departure at length arrives. The angels
beckon him away; Jesus bids him come; and
as he departs this life he looks back with a
heavenly smile on surviving friends, and is
enabled to say, "Whither I go, ye know, and
the way ye know." An entrance is ministered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
unto him abundantly into the everlasting
kingdom of his Lord and Savior.</p>

<p>III. Having considered the state to which
we look, and the mode of our admission, let
us consider the condition of it. This is implied
in the word "so." "For so an entrance shall
be ministered unto you." In the preceding
part of this chapter, the apostle has pointed
out the meaning of this expression, and in the
text merely sums it all up in that short mode
of expression.</p>

<p>The first condition he shows to be, the obtaining
like precious faith with him, through
the righteousness of God and our Savior
Jesus Christ. Not a faith which merely assents
to the truths of the gospel record, but
a faith which applies the merits of the death
of Christ to expiate my individual guilt;
which lays hold on Him as my sacrifice, and
produces, in its exercises, peace with God, a
knowledge of the divine favor, a sense of sin
forgiven, and a full certainty, arising from
a divine impression on the heart, made by the
Spirit of God, that I am accepted in the Beloved
and made a child of God.</p>

<p>If those who profess the Gospel of Christ
were but half as zealous in seeking after this
enjoyment as they are in discovering creaturely
objections to its attainment, it would
be enjoyed by thousands who at present know
nothing of its happy reality. Such persons,
unfortunately for themselves, employ much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
more assiduity in searching a vocabulary to
find out epithets of reproach to attach to those
who maintain the doctrine than in searching
that volume which declares that "if you are
sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of his Son
into your hearts, crying Abba, Father"; and
that "he that believeth hath the witness in
himself." In whatever light a scorner may
view this doctrine now, the time will come
when, being found without the wedding garment,
he will be cast into outer darkness.</p>

<p>O sinner! cry to God this day to convince
thee of thy need of this salvation, and then
thou wilt be in a condition to receive it:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Shalt know, shalt feel thy sins forgiven,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Bless'd with this antepast of heaven."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But, besides this, the apostle requires that
we then henceforth preserve consciences void
of offense toward God and toward man. This
faith which obtains the forgiveness of sin
unites to Christ, and by this union we are
made, as St. Peter declares, "partakers of the
divine nature": and as He who has called
you is holy, so you are to be holy in all manner
of conversation. For yours is a faith
which not only casts out sin, but purifies the
heart&mdash;the conscience having been once
purged by the sprinkling of the blood of
Christ, you are not to suffer guilt to be again
contracted; for the salvation of Christ is not
only from the penalty, but from the very stain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
of sin; not only from its guilt, but from its
pollution; not only from its condemnation,
but from its very "in-being"; "The blood of
Jesus Christ cleanseth from all sin"; and
"For this purpose was the Son of God manifested,
that he might destroy the works of
the devil." You are therefore required by
St. Peter, "to escape the corruption that is
in the world through lust," and thus to perfect
holiness in the fear of the Lord!</p>

<p>Finally, live in progressive and practical
godliness. Not only possess, but practise, the
virtues of religion; not only practise, but increase
therein, abounding in the work of the
Lord! Lead up, hand in hand, in the same
delightful chorus, all the graces which adorn
the Christian character. Having the divine
nature, possessing a new and living principle,
let diligent exercise reduce it to practical holiness;
and you will be easily discerned from
those formal hypocrites, whose faith and religion
are but a barren and unfruitful speculation.</p>

<p>To conclude: live to God&mdash;live for God&mdash;live
in God; and let your moderation be
known unto all men&mdash;the Lord is at hand:
"Therefore giving all diligence, add to your
faith virtue; and to virtue, knowledge; and
to knowledge, temperance; and to temperance,
patience; and to patience, godliness; and to
godliness, brotherly kindness; and to brotherly
kindness, charity."</p>

<h4>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">John Henry Newman</span> was born in London
in 1801. He won high honors at
Oxford, and in 1828 was appointed vicar
of the University Church, St. Mary's, and
with Keble and Pusey headed the Oxford
Movement. In the pulpit of St. Mary's
he soon showed himself to be a power.
His sermons, exquisite, tho simple in
style, chiefly deal with various phases of
personal religion which he illustrated with
a keen spiritual insight, a sympathetic
glow, an exalted earnestness and a breadth
of range, unparalleled in English pulpit
utterances before his time. His extreme
views on questions of catholicity, sacerdotalism
and the sacraments, as well as his
craving for an infallible authority in
matters of faith, shook his confidence in
the Church of England and he went over
to Rome in 1845. He was made Cardinal
in 1879 and died in 1890.</p>

<h2>NEWMAN</h2>

<h3>1801-1890</h3>

<h4>GOD'S WILL THE END OF LIFE</h4>

<p><em>I came down from heaven not to do mine own will
but the will of him that sent me.</em>&mdash;John vi., 38.</p>


<p>I am going to ask you a question, my dear
brethren, so trite, and therefore so uninteresting
at first sight, that you may
wonder why I put it, and may object that it
will be difficult to fix the mind on it, and may
anticipate that nothing profitable can be made
of it. It is this: "Why were you sent into
the world?" Yet, after all, it is perhaps a
thought more obvious than it is common, more
easy than it is familiar; I mean it ought to
come into your minds, but it does not, and
you never had more than a distant acquaintance
with it, tho that sort of acquaintance
with it you have had for many years. Nay,
once or twice, perhaps you have been thrown
across the thought somewhat intimately, for a
short season, but this was an accident which
did not last. There are those who recollect
the first time, as it would seem, when it came
home to them. They were but little children,
and they were by themselves, and they spontaneously
asked themselves, or rather God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
spake in them, "Why am I here? how came
I here? who brought me here? What am I
to do here?" Perhaps it was the first act of
reason, the beginning of their real responsibility,
the commencement of their trial; perhaps
from that day they may date their capacity,
their awful power, of choosing between
good and evil, and of committing mortal sin.
And so, as life goes on, the thought comes vividly,
from time to time, for a short season
across their conscience; whether in illness, or
in some anxiety, or at some season of solitude,
or on hearing some preacher, or reading some
religious work. A vivid feeling comes over
them of the vanity and unprofitableness of
the world, and then the question recurs,
"Why then am I sent into it?"</p>

<p>And a great contrast indeed does this vain,
unprofitable, yet overbearing world present
with such a question as that. It seems out of
place to ask such a question in so magnificent,
so imposing a presence, as that of the great
Babylon. The world professes to supply all
that we need, as if we were sent into it for
the sake of being sent here, and for nothing
beyond the sending. It is a great favor to
have an introduction to this august world.
This is to be our exposition, forsooth, of the
mystery of life. Every man is doing his own
will here, seeking his own pleasure, pursuing
his own ends; that is why he was brought
into existence. Go abroad into the streets of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
the populous city, contemplate the continuous
outpouring there of human energy, and
the countless varieties of human character,
and be satisfied! The ways are thronged, carriage-way
and pavement; multitudes are hurrying
to and fro, each on his own errand, or
are loitering about from listlessness, or from
want of work, or have come forth into the public
concourse, to see and to be seen, for amusement
or for display, or on the excuse of business.
The carriages of the wealthy mingle
with the slow wains laden with provisions or
merchandise, the productions of art or the demands
of luxury. The streets are lined with
shops, open and gay, inviting customers, and
widen now and then into some spacious square
or place, with lofty masses of brickwork or
of stone, gleaming in the fitful sunbeam, and
surrounded or fronted with what simulates a
garden's foliage. Follow them in another direction,
and you find the whole groundstead
covered with large buildings, planted thickly
up and down, the homes of the mechanical
arts. The air is filled, below, with a ceaseless,
importunate, monotonous din, which penetrates
even to your innermost chamber, and
rings in your ears even when you are not
conscious of it; and overhead, with a canopy
of smoke, shrouding God's day from the
realms of obstinate, sullen toil. This is the
end of man!</p>

<p>Or stay at home, and take up one of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
daily prints, which are so true a picture of
the world; look down the columns of advertisements,
and you will see the catalog of
pursuits, projects, aims, anxieties, amusements,
indulgences which occupy the mind of
man. He plays many parts: here he has goods
to sell, there he wants employment; there
again he seeks to borrow money, here he offers
you houses, great seats or small tenements;
he has food for the million, and luxuries for
the wealthy, and sovereign medicines for the
credulous, and books, new and cheap, for the
inquisitive. Pass on to the news of the day,
and you will learn what great men are doing
at home and abroad: you will read of wars
and rumors of wars; of debates in the legislature;
of rising men, and old statesmen going
off the scene; of political contests in this city
or that country; of the collision of rival interests.
You will read of the money market,
and the provision market, and the market for
metals; of the state of trade, the call for manufactures,
news of ships arrived in port, of
accidents at sea, of exports and imports, of
gains and losses, of frauds and their detection.
Go forward, and you arrive at discoveries in
art and science, discoveries (so-called) in religion,
the court and royalty, the entertainments
of the great, places of amusement,
strange trials, offenses, accidents, escapes, exploits,
experiments, contests, ventures. Oh,
this curious restless, clamorous, panting being,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
which we call life!&mdash;and is there to be no end
to all this? Is there no object in it? It never
has an end, it is forsooth its own object!</p>

<p>And now, once more, my brethren, put aside
what you see and what you read of the world,
and try to penetrate into the hearts, and to
reach the ideas and the feelings of those who
constitute it; look into them as closely as you
can; enter into their houses and private rooms;
strike at random through the streets and
lanes: take as they come, palace and hovel,
office or factory, and what will you find? Listen
to their words, witness, alas! their works;
you will find in the main the same lawless
thoughts, the same unrestrained desires, the
same ungoverned passions, the same earthly
opinions, the same wilful deeds, in high and
low, learned and unlearned; you will find
them all to be living for the sake of living;
they one and all seem to tell you, "We are
our own center, our own end." Why are they
toiling? why are they scheming? for what are
they living? "We live to please ourselves; life
is worthless except we have our own way; we
are not sent here at all, but we find ourselves
here, and we are but slaves unless we can think
what we will, believe what we will, love what
we will, hate what we will, do what we will.
We detest interference on the part of God
or man. We do not bargain to be rich or to
be great; but we do bargain, whether rich or
poor, high or low, to live for ourselves, to live<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
for the lust of the moment, or, according to
the doctrine of the hour, thinking of the future
and the unseen just as much or as little
as we please."</p>

<p>Oh, my brethren, is it not a shocking thought,
but who can deny its truth? The multitude
of men are living without any aim beyond this
visible scene; they may from time to time use
religious words, or they may profess a communion
or a worship, as a matter of course,
or of expedience, or of duty, but, if there was
sincerity in such profession, the course of the
world could not run as it does. What a contrast
is all this to the end of life, as it is set
before us in our most holy faith! If there
was one among the sons of men, who might
allowably have taken his pleasure, and have
done his own will here below, surely it was
He who came down on earth from the bosom
of the Father, and who was so pure and spotless
in that human nature which He put on
Him, that He could have no human purpose
or aim inconsistent with the will of His
Father. Yet He, the Son of God, the Eternal
Word, came, not to do His own will, but His
who sent Him, as you know very well is told
us again and again in Scripture. Thus the
Prophet in the Psalter, speaking in His person,
says, "Lo, I come to do thy will, O God."
And He says in the Prophet Isaiah, "The
Lord God hath opened mine ear, and I do
not resist; I have not gone back." And in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
the gospel, when He hath come on earth, "My
food is to do the will of him that sent me,
and to finish his work." Hence, too, in His
agony, He cried out, "Not my will, but thine,
be done;" and St. Paul, in like manner, says,
that "Christ pleased not himself;" and elsewhere,
that, "tho he was God's Son, yet
learned he obedience by the things which he
suffered." Surely so it was; as being indeed
the eternal coequal Son, His will was one
and the same with the Father's will, and He
had no submission of will to make; but He
chose to take on Him man's nature and
the will of that nature; he chose to take on
Him affections, feelings, and inclinations
proper to man, a will innocent indeed and
good, but still a man's will, distinct from
God's will; a will, which, had it acted simply
according to what was pleasing to its
nature, would, when pain and toil were to
be endured, have held back from an active
cooperation with the will of God. But, tho
He took on Himself the nature of man, He
took not on Him that selfishness, with which
fallen man wraps himself round, but in all
things He devoted Himself as a ready sacrifice
to His Father. He came on earth, not to
take His pleasure, not to follow His taste, not
for the mere exercise of human affection, but
simply to glorify His Father and to do His
will. He came charged with a mission, deputed
for a work; He looked not to the right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
nor to the left, He thought not of Himself, He
offered Himself up to God.</p>

<p>Hence it is that He was carried in the
womb of a poor woman, who, before His birth,
had two journeys to make, of love and of
obedience, to the mountains and to Bethlehem.
He was born in a stable, and laid in a manger.
He was hurried off to Egypt to sojourn there;
then He lived till He was thirty years of age
in a poor way, by a rough trade, in a small
house, in a despised town. Then, when He
went out to preach, He had not where to lay
His head; He wandered up and down the
country, as a stranger upon earth. He was
driven out into the wilderness, and dwelt
among the wild beasts. He endured heat and
cold, hunger and weariness, reproach and
calumny. His food was coarse bread, and
fish from the lake, or depended on the hospitality
of strangers. And as He had already
left His Father's greatness on high, and had
chosen an earthly home; so again, at that
Father's bidding, He gave up the sole solace
given Him in this world, and denied Himself
His mother's presence. He parted with her
who bore Him; He endured to be strange to
her; He endured to call her coldly "woman,"
who was His own undefiled one, all beautiful,
all gracious, the best creature of His hands,
and the sweet nurse of His infancy. He put
her aside, as Levi, His type, merited the sacred
ministry, by saying to His parents and kinsmen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
"I know you not." He exemplified in
His own person the severe maxim, which He
gave to His disciples, "He that loveth more
than me is not worthy of me." In all these
many ways He sacrificed every wish of His
own; that we might understand, that, if He,
the Creator, came into His world, not for His
own pleasure, but to do His Father's will, we
too have most surely some work to do, and
have seriously to bethink ourselves what that
work is.</p>

<p>Yes, so it is; realize it, my brethren;&mdash;every
one who breathes, high and low, educated and
ignorant, young and old, man and woman,
has a mission, has a work. We are not sent
into this world for nothing; we are not born
at random; we are not here, that we may go
to bed at night, and get up in the morning,
toil for our bread, eat and drink, laugh and
joke, sin when we have a mind, and reform
when we are tired of sinning, rear a family
and die. God sees every one of us; He creates
every soul, He lodges it in the body, one by
one, for a purpose. He needs, He deigns to
need, every one of us. He has an end for
each of us; we are all equal in His sight, and
we are placed in our different ranks and stations,
not to get what we can out of them for
ourselves, but to labor in them for Him. As
Christ had His work, we too have ours; as
He rejoiced to do His work, we must rejoice
in ours also.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>St. Paul on one occasion speaks of the world
as a scene in a theater. Consider what is
meant by this. You know, actors on a stage
are on an equality with each other really, but
for the occasion they assume a difference of
character; some are high, some are low, some
are merry, and some sad. Well, would it not
be simple absurdity in any actor to pride himself
on his mock diadem, or his edgeless
sword, instead of attending to his part? What,
if he did but gaze at himself and his dress?
what, if he secreted, or turned to his own use,
what was valuable in it? Is it not his business,
and nothing else, to act his part well?
Common sense tells us so. Now we are all
but actors in this world; we are one and all
equal, we shall be judged as equals as soon as
life is over; yet, equal and similar in ourselves,
each has his special part at present,
each has his work, each has his mission,&mdash;not
to indulge his passions, not to make money,
not to get a name in the world, not to save
himself trouble, not to follow his bent, not to
be selfish and self-willed, but to do what God
puts on him to do.</p>

<p>Look at the poor profligate in the gospel,
look at Dives; do you think he understood
that his wealth was to be spent, not on himself,
but for the glory of God?&mdash;yet forgetting
this, he was lost for ever and ever. I will tell
you what he thought, and how he viewed
things: he was a young man, and had succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
to a good estate, and he determined to
enjoy himself. It did not strike him that his
wealth had any other use than that of enabling
him to take his pleasure. Lazarus lay at
his gate; he might have relieved Lazarus; that
was God's will; but he managed to put conscience
aside, and he persuaded himself he
should be a fool, if he did not make the most
of this world, while he had the means. So he
resolved to have his fill of pleasure; and feasting
was to his mind a principal part of it.
"He fared sumptuously every day"; everything
belonging to him was in the best style,
as men speak; his house, his furniture, his
plate of silver and gold, his attendants, his
establishments. Everything was for enjoyment,
and for show, too; to attract the eyes
of the world, and to gain the applause and
admiration of his equals, who were the companions
of his sins. These companions were
doubtless such as became a person of such pretensions;
they were fashionable men; a collection
of refined, high-bred, haughty men,
eating, not gluttonously, but what was rare
and costly; delicate, exact, fastidious in their
taste, from their very habits of indulgence;
not eating for the mere sake of eating, or
drinking for the mere sake of drinking, but
making a sort of science of their sensuality;
sensual, carnal, as flesh and blood can be, with
eyes, ears, tongue steeped in impurity, every
thought, look, and sense, witnessing or ministering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
to the evil one who ruled them; yet,
with exquisite correctness of idea and judgment,
laying down rules for sinning;&mdash;heartless
and selfish, high, punctilious, and disdainful
in their outward deportment, and shrinking
from Lazarus, who lay at the gate, as an
eye-sore, who ought for the sake of decency
to be put out of the way. Dives was one of
such, and so he lived his short span, thinking
of nothing but himself, till one day he got into
a fatal quarrel with one of his godless associates,
or he caught some bad illness; and
then he lay helpless on his bed of pain, cursing
fortune and his physician that he was no
better, and impatient that he was thus kept
from enjoying his youth, trying to fancy himself
mending when he was getting worse, and
disgusted at those who would not throw him
some word of comfort in his suspense, and
turning more resolutely from his Creator in
proportion to his suffering;&mdash;and then at last
his day came, and he died, and (oh! miserable!)
"was buried in hell." And so ended
he and his mission.</p>

<p>This was the fate of your pattern and idol,
oh, ye, if any of you be present, young men,
who, tho not possest of wealth and rank, yet
affect the fashions of those who have them.
You, my brethren, have not been born splendidly,
or nobly; you have not been brought
up in the seats of liberal education; you have
no high connections; you have not learned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
the manners nor caught the tone of good society;
you have no share of the largeness of
mind, the candor, the romantic sense of honor,
the correctness of taste, the consideration for
others, and the gentleness which the world
puts forth as its highest type of excellence;
you have not come near the courts of the
mansions of the great; yet you ape the sin
of Dives, while you are strangers to his refinement.
You think it the sign of a gentleman
to set yourselves above religion; to criticize
the religious and professors of religion;
to look at Catholic and Methodist with impartial
contempt; to gain a smattering of knowledge
on a number of subjects; to dip into a
number of frivolous publications, if they are
popular; to have read the latest novel; to have
heard the singer and seen the actor of the day;
to be well up with the news; to know the
names and, if so be, the persons of public men,
to be able to bow to them; to walk up and
down the street with your heads on high, and
to stare at whatever meets you; and to say
and do worse things, of which these outward
extravagances are but the symbol. And this
is what you conceive you have come upon the
earth for! The Creator made you, it seems,
oh, my children, for this work and office, to be
a bad imitation of polished ungodliness, to be
a piece of tawdry and faded finery, or a scent
which has lost its freshness, and does not but
offend the sense! O! that you could see how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
absurd and base are such pretenses in the
eyes of any but yourselves! No calling of life
but is honorable; no one is ridiculous who acts
suitably to his calling and estate; no one, who
has good sense and humility, but may, in any
state of life, be truly well-bred and refined;
but ostentation, affectation, and ambitious efforts
are, in every station of life, high or low,
nothing but vulgarities. Put them aside, despise
them yourselves. Oh, my very dear sons,
whom I love, and whom I would fain serve;&mdash;oh,
that you could feel that you have souls!
oh, that you would have mercy on your souls!
oh, that, before it is too late, you would betake
yourselves to Him who is the source of
all that is truly high and magnificent and
beautiful, all that is bright and pleasant and
secure what you ignorantly seek, in Him
whom you so wilfully, so awfully despise!</p>

<p>He, alone, the Son of God, "the brightness
of the Eternal Light, and the spotless mirror
of His Majesty," is the source of all good and
all happiness to rich and poor, high and low.
If you were ever so high, you would need
Him; if you were ever so low, you could offend
Him. The poor can offend Him; the
poor man can neglect his divinely appointed
mission as well as the rich. Do not suppose,
my brethren, that what I have said against
the upper or the middle class will not, if you
happen to be poor, also lie against you.
Though a man were as poor as Lazarus, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
could be as guilty as Dives. If you were resolved
to degrade yourselves to the brutes of
the field, who have no reason and no conscience,
you need not wealth or rank to enable
you to do so. Brutes have no wealth; they
have no pride of life; they have no purple
and fine linen, no splendid table, no retinue
of servants, and yet they are brutes. They
are brutes by the law of their nature; they
are the poorest among the poor; there is not
a vagrant and outcast who is so poor as they;
they differ from him, not in their possessions,
but in their want of a soul, in that he has a
mission and they have not, he can sin and
they can not. Oh, my brethren, it stands to
reason, a man may intoxicate himself with a
cheap draft, as well as with a costly one;
he may steal another's money for his appetites,
though he does not waste his own upon
them; he may break through the natural and
social laws which encircle him, and profane
the sanctity of family duties, tho he be not
a child of nobles, but a peasant or artisan,&mdash;nay,
and perhaps he does so more frequently
than they. This is not the poor's
blessedness, that he has less temptations to
self-indulgence, for he has as many, but that
from his circumstances he receives the penances
and corrections of self-indulgence. Poverty
is the mother of many pains and sorrows
in their season, and these are God's messengers
to lead the soul to repentance; but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
alas! if the poor man indulges his passions,
thinks little of religion, puts off repentance,
refuses to make an effort, and dies without
conversion, it matters nothing that he was
poor in this world, it matters nothing that he
was less daring than the rich, it matters not
that he promised himself God's favor, that he
sent for the priest when death came, and received
the last sacraments; Lazarus too, in
that case, shall be buried with Dives in hell,
and shall have had his consolation neither in
this world nor in the world to come.</p>

<p>My brethren, the simple question is, whatever
a man's rank in life may be, does he in
that rank perform the work which God has
given him to do? Now then, let me turn to
others, of a very different description, and
let me hear what they will say, when the question
is asked them. Why, they will parry it
thus: "You give us no alternative," they will
say to me, "except that of being sinners or
saints. You put before us our Lord's pattern,
and you spread before us the guilt and ruin
of the deliberate transgressor; whereas we
have no intention of going so far one way or
the other; we do not aim at being saints, but
we have no desire at all to be sinners. We
neither intend to disobey God's will, nor to
give up our own. Surely there is a middle
way, and a safe one, in which God's will and
our will may both be satisfied. We mean to
enjoy both this world and the next. We will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
guard against mortal sin; we are not obliged
to guard against venial; indeed it would be
endless to attempt it. None but saints do so;
it is the work of a life; we need have nothing
else to do. We are not monks, we are in the
world, we are in business, we are parents, we
have families; we must live for the day. It is
a consolation to keep from mortal sin; that
we do, and it is enough for salvation. It is
a great thing to keep in God's favor; what
indeed can we desire more? We come at due
time to the sacraments; this is our comfort
and our stay; did we die, we should die in
grace, and escape the doom of the wicked.
But if we once attempted to go further, where
should we stop? how will you draw the line
for us? The line between mortal and venial
sin is very distinct; we understand that; but
do you not see that, if we attended to our
venial sins, there would be just as much reason
to attend to one as to another? If we began to
repress our anger, why not also repress vainglory?
Why not also guard against niggardliness?
Why not also keep from falsehood,
from gossiping, from idling, from excess
in eating? And, after all, without venial
sin we never can be, unless indeed we have
the prerogative of the Mother of God, which
it would be almost heresy to ascribe to any
one but her. You are not asking us to be
converted; that we understand; we are converted,
we were converted a long time ago.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
You bid us aim at an indefinite vague something,
which is less than perfection, yet more
than obedience, and which, without resulting
in any tangible advantage, debars us from
the pleasures and embarrasses us in the duties
of this world."</p>

<p>This is what you will say; but your premises,
my brethren, are better than your reasoning,
and your conclusions will not stand.
You have a right view why God has sent you
into the world; viz., in order that you may
get to heaven; it is quite true also that you
would fare well indeed if you found yourselves
there, you could desire nothing better;
nor, it is true, can you live any time without
venial sin. It is true also that you are not
obliged to aim at being saints; it is no sin
not to aim at perfection. So much is true and
to the purpose; but it does not follow from it
that you, with such views and feelings as you
have exprest, are using sufficient exertions
even for attaining purgatory. Has your religion
any difficulty in it, or is it in all respects
easy to you? Are you simply taking
your own pleasure in your mode of living, or
do you find your pleasure in submitting yourself
to God's pleasure? In a word, is your
religion a work? For if it be not, it is not
religion at all. Here at once, before going
into your argument, is a proof that it is an
unsound one, because it brings you to the conclusion
that, whereas Christ came to do a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
work, and all saints, nay, nay, and sinners to
do a work too, you, on the contrary, have no
work to do, because, forsooth, you are neither
sinners nor saints; or, if you once had a work,
at least that you have despatched it already,
and you have nothing upon your hands. You
have attained your salvation, it seems, before
your time, and have nothing to occupy you,
and are detained on earth too long. The work
days are over, and your perpetual holiday is
begun. Did then God send you, above all
other men, into the world to be idle in spiritual
matters? Is it your mission only to find
pleasure in this world, in which you are but
as pilgrims and sojourners? Are you more
than sons of Adam, who, by the sweat of their
brow, are to eat bread till they return to the
earth out of which they are taken? Unless
you have some work in hand, unless you are
struggling, unless you are fighting with yourselves,
you are no followers of those who
"through many tribulations entered into the
kingdom of God." A fight is the very token
of a Christian. He is a soldier of Christ; high
or low, he is this and nothing else. If you
have triumphed over all mortal sin, as you
seem to think, then you must attack your
venial sins; there is no help for it; there is
nothing else to do, if you would be soldiers of
Jesus Christ. But, oh, simple souls! to think
you have gained any triumph at all! No; you
cannot safely be at peace with any, even the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
least malignant, of the foes of God; if you
are at peace with venial sins, be certain that in
their company and under their shadow mortal
sins are lurking. Mortal sins are the children
of venial, which, tho they be not deadly
themselves, yet are prolific of death. You
may think that you have killed the giants who
had possession of your hearts, and that you
have nothing to fear, but may sit at rest under
your vine and under your fig-tree; but the
giants will live again, they will rise from the
dust, and, before you know where you are,
you will be taken captive and slaughtered by
the fierce, powerful, and eternal enemies of
God.</p>

<p>The end of a thing is the test. It was our
Lord's rejoicing in His last solemn hour, that
He had done the work for which He was sent.
"I have glorified thee on earth." He says in
His prayer, "I have finished the work which
thou gavest me to do; I have manifested thy
name to the men whom thou hast given me
out of the world." It was St. Paul's consolation
also, "I have fought the good fight, I
have finished the course, I have kept the
faith; henceforth there is laid up for me a
crown of justice, which the Lord shall render
to me in that day, the just judge." Alas!
alas! how different will be our view of things
when we come to die, or when we have passed
into eternity, from the dreams and pretenses
with which we beguile ourselves now! What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
will Babel do for us then? Will it rescue our
souls from the purgatory or the hell to which
it sends them? If we were created, it was
that we might serve God; if we have His gifts,
it is that we may glorify Him; if we have a
conscience, it is that we may obey it; if we
have the prospect of heaven, it is that we may
keep it before us; if we have light, that we
may follow it, if we have grace, that we may
save ourselves by means of it. Alas! alas! for
those who die without fulfilling their mission;
who were called to be holy, and lived in sin;
who were called to worship Christ, and who
plunged into this giddy and unbelieving
world; who were called to fight, and who remained
idle; who were called to be Catholics,
and who did but remain in the religion of
their birth! Alas for those who have had gifts
and talent, and have not used, or have misused,
or abused them; who have had wealth,
and have spent it on themselves; who have
had abilities, and have advocated what was
sinful, or ridiculed what was true, or scattered
doubts against what was sacred; who have had
leisure, and have wasted it on wicked companions,
or evil books, or foolish amusements!
Alas! for those of whom the best can be said
is, that they are harmless and naturally blameless,
while they never have attempted to
cleanse their hearts or to live in God's sight!</p>

<p>The world goes on from age to age, but the
Holy Angels and Blessed Saints are always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
crying Alas, alas! and Wo, wo! over the loss
of vocations, and the disappointment of hopes,
and the scorn of God's love, and the ruin of
souls. One generation succeeds another, and
whenever they look down upon earth from
their golden thrones, they see scarcely anything
but a multitude of guardian spirits,
downcast and sad, each following his own
charge, in anxiety, or in terror, or in despair,
vainly endeavoring to shield him from the
enemy, and failing because he will not be
shielded. Times come and go, and man will
not believe, that that is to be which is not yet,
or that what now is only continues for a season,
and is not eternity. The end is the trial;
the world passes; it is but a pageant and a
scene; the lofty palace crumbles, the busy city
is mute, the ships of Tarshish have sped away.
On heart and flesh death is coming; the veil
is breaking. Departing soul, how hast thou
used thy talents, thy opportunities, the light
poured around thee, the warnings given thee,
the grace inspired into thee? Oh, my Lord
and Savior, support me in that hour in the
strong arms of Thy sacraments, and by the
fresh fragrance of Thy consolations. Let the
absolving words be said over me, and the holy
oil sign and seal me, and Thy own body be
my food, and Thy blood my sprinkling; and
let my sweet mother Mary breathe on me, and
my angel whisper peace to me, and my glorious
saints, and my own dear father, Philip,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
smile on me; that in them all, and through
them all, I may receive the gift of perseverance,
and die, as I desire to live, in Thy faith,
in Thy Church, in Thy service, and in Thy
love.</p>

<h4>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</h4>


<p><span class="smcap">Horace Bushnell</span> was born at Litchfield,
Connecticut, in 1802. Graduated at
Yale 1827. In 1833 he became pastor of
the North Congregational Church, Hartford,
Conn., resigned in 1859 and died
in 1876. He wrote many theological
works. Among them "Christian Nurture"
(1847), a book now looked upon as
of classical authority. Considerable discussion
among Calvinists was aroused by
his "Nature and the Supernatural," and
his "The Vicarious Sacrifice" (1865) as
being out of accord with the accepted
creeds of the Congregational churches.
He lacked the sympathy and dramatic
instinct necessary to great oratorical
achievement, but his sermons prove by
their profound suggestiveness that he was
a man of keen spiritual insight, and
preached with force and impressiveness.
His influence upon the ministers of America
in modifying theology and remolding
the general type of preaching is fairly
comparable with that of Robertson.</p>

<h4>UNCONSCIOUS INFLUENCE<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></h4>

<p><em>Then went in also that other disciple.</em>&mdash;John xx., 8.</p>


<p>In this slight touch or turn of history, is
opened to us, if we scan closely, one of the
most serious and fruitful chapters of
Christian doctrine. Thus it is that men are ever
touching unconsciously the springs of motion
in each other; thus it is that one man, without
thought or intention, or even a consciousness
of the fact, is ever leading some other after
him. Little does Peter think, as he comes up
where his doubting brother is looking into the
sepulcher, and goes straight in, after his
peculiar manner, that he is drawing in his
brother apostle after him. As little does John
think, when he loses his misgivings, and goes
into the sepulcher after Peter, that he is
following his brother. And just so, unaware
to himself, is every man, the whole race
through, laying hold of his fellow-man, to lead
him where otherwise he would not go. We
overrun the boundaries of our personality&mdash;we
flow together. A Peter leads a John, a
John goes after Peter, both of them unconscious
of any influence exerted or received.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
And thus our life and conduct are ever
propagating themselves, by a law of social
contagion, throughout the circles and times
in which we live.</p>

<p>There are, then, you will perceive, two sorts
of influence belonging to man; that which is
active or voluntary, and that which is unconscious&mdash;that
which we exert purposely or in
the endeavor to sway another, as by teaching,
by argument, by persuasion, by threatenings,
by offers and promises, and that which flows
out from us, unaware to ourselves, the same
which Peter had over John when he led him
into the sepulcher. The importance of our
efforts to do good, that is of our voluntary
influence, and the sacred obligation we are
under to exert ourselves in this way, are often
and seriously insisted on. It is thus that
Christianity has become, in the present age, a
principle of so much greater activity than it
has been for many centuries before; and we
fervently hope that it will yet become far
more active than it now is, nor cease to multiply
its industry, till it is seen by all mankind
to embody the beneficence and the living
energy of Christ Himself.</p>

<p>But there needs to be reproduced, at the
same time, and partly for this object, a more
thorough appreciation of the relative importance
of that kind of influence or beneficence
which is insensibly exerted. The tremendous
weight and efficacy of this, compared with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
the other, and the sacred responsibility laid
upon us in regard to this, are felt in no such
degree or proportion as they should be; and
the consequent loss we suffer in character, as
well as that which the Church suffers in
beauty and strength, is incalculable. The
more stress, too, needs to be laid on this subject
of insensible influence, because it is insensible;
because it is out of mind, and, when
we seek to trace it, beyond a full discovery.</p>

<p>If the doubt occur to any of you, in the announcement
of this subject, whether we are
properly responsible for an influence which
we exert insensibly; we are not, I reply, except
so far as this influence flows directly
from our character and conduct. And this it
does, even much more uniformly than our
active influence. In the latter we may fail of
our end by a want of wisdom or skill, in
which case we are still as meritorious, in God's
sight, as if we succeeded. So, again, we may
really succeed, and do great good by our
active endeavors, from motives altogether base
and hypocritical, in which case we are as evil,
in God's sight, as if we had failed. But the
influences we exert unconsciously will almost
never disagree with our real character. They
are honest influences, following our character,
as the shadow follows the sun. And, therefore,
we are much more certainly responsible
for them, and their effects on the world. They
go streaming from us in all directions, tho<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
in channels that we do not see, poisoning or
healing around the roots of society, and
among the hidden wells of character. If good
ourselves, they are good; if bad, they are bad.
And, since they reflect so exactly our character,
it is impossible to doubt our responsibility
for their effects on the world. We must
answer not only for what we do with a purpose,
but for the influence we exert insensibly.
To give you any just impressions of the
breadth and seriousness of such a reckoning
I know to be impossible. No mind can trace
it. But it will be something gained if I am
able to awaken only a suspicion of the vast
extent and power of those influences, which
are ever flowing out unbidden upon society,
from your life and character.</p>

<p>In the prosecution of my design, let me ask
of you, first of all, to expel the common prejudice
that there can be nothing of consequence
in unconscious influences, because they make
no report, and fall on the world unobserved.
Histories and biographies make little account
of the power men exert insensibly over each
other. They tell how men have led armies,
established empires, enacted laws, gained
causes, sung, reasoned, and taught&mdash;always
occupied in setting forth what they do with a
purpose. But what they do without purpose,
the streams of influence that flow out from
their persons unbidden on the world, they can
not trace or compute, and seldom even mention.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
So also the public laws make men
responsible only for what they do with a
positive purpose, and take no account of the
mischiefs or benefits that are communicated
by their noxious or healthful example. The
same is true in the discipline of families,
churches, and schools; they make no account
of the things we do, except we will them.
What we do insensibly passes for nothing,
because no human government can trace such
influences with sufficient certainty to make
their authors responsible.</p>

<p>But you must not conclude that influences
of this kind are insignificant, because they are
unnoticed and noiseless. How is it in the
natural world? Behind the mere show, the
outward noise and stir of the world, nature
always conceals her hand of control, and the
laws by which she rules. Who ever saw with
the eye, for example, or heard with the ear,
the exertions of that tremendous astronomic
force, which every moment holds the compact
of the physical universe together? The lightning
is, in fact, but a mere firefly spark in
comparison; but, because it glares on the
clouds, and thunders so terribly in the ear,
and rives the tree or the rock where it falls,
many will be ready to think that it is a vastly
more potent agent than gravity.</p>

<p>The Bible calls the good man's life a light,
and it is the nature of light to flow out spontaneously
in all directions, and fill the world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
unconsciously with its beams. So the Christian
shines, it would say, not so much because
he will, as because he is a luminous object.
Not that the active influence of Christians is
made of no account in the figure, but only that
this symbol of light has its propriety in the
fact that their unconscious influence is the
chief influence, and has the precedence in its
power over the world. And yet, there are
many who will be ready to think that light is
a very tame and feeble instrument, because
it is noiseless. An earthquake, for example,
is to them a much more vigorous and effective
agency. Hear how it comes thundering
through solid foundations of nature. It rocks
a whole continent. The noblest works of man&mdash;cities,
monuments, and temples&mdash;are in a
moment leveled to the ground, or swallowed
down the opening gulfs of fire. Little do they
think that the light of every morning, the soft,
and genial, and silent light, is an agent many
times more powerful. But let the light of the
morning cease and return no more, let the
hour of morning come, and bring with it no
dawn; the outcries of a horror-stricken world
fill the air, and make, as it were, the darkness
audible. The beasts go wild and frantic at the
loss of the sun. The vegetable growths turn
pale and die. A chill creeps on, and frosty
winds begin to howl across the freezing earth.
Colder, and yet colder, is the night. The vital
blood, at length, of all creatures, stops congealed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
Down goes the frost toward the
earth's center. The heart of the sea is frozen;
nay, the earthquakes are themselves frozen in,
under their fiery caverns. The very globe
itself, too, and all the fellow planets that have
lost their sun, are become mere balls of ice,
swinging silent in the darkness. Such is the
light, which revisits us in the silence of the
morning. It makes no shock or scar. It
would not wake an infant in his cradle. And
yet it perpetually new creates the world, rescuing
it each morning, as a prey, from night
and chaos. So the Christian is a light, even
"the light of the world," and we must not
think that, because he shines insensibly or
silently, as a mere luminous object, he is
therefore powerless. The greatest powers are
ever those which lie back of the little stirs and
commotion of nature; and I verily believe
that the insensible influences of good men are
much more potent than what I have called
their voluntary, or active, as the great silent
powers of nature are of greater consequence
than her little disturbances and tumults. The
law of human influences is deeper than many
suspect, and they lose sight of it altogether.
The outward endeavors made by good men or
bad to sway others, they call their influence;
whereas, it is, in fact, but a fraction, and, in
most cases, but a very small fraction, of the
good or evil that flows out of their lives. Nay,
I will even go further. How many persons do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
you meet, the insensible influence of whose
manners and character is so decided as often
to thwart their voluntary influence; so that,
whatever they attempt to do, in the way of
controlling others, they are sure to carry the
exact opposite of what they intend! And it
will generally be found that, where men
undertake by argument or persuasion to exert
a power, in the face of qualities that make
them odious or detestable, or only not entitled
to respect, their insensible influence will be
too strong for them. The total effect of the
life is then of a kind directly opposite to the
voluntary endeavor, which, of course, does not
add so much as a fraction to it.</p>

<p>I call your attention, next, to the twofold
powers of effect and expression by which man
connects with his fellow man. If we distinguish
man as a creature of language, and
thus qualified to communicate himself to
others, there are in him two sets or kinds of
language, one which is voluntary in the use,
and one that is involuntary; that of speech in
the literal sense, and that expression of the
eye, the face, the look, the gait, the motion,
the tone of cadence, which is sometimes called
the natural language of the sentiments. This
natural language, too, is greatly enlarged by
the conduct of life, that which, in business
and society, reveals the principles and spirit
of men. Speech, or voluntary language, is a
door to the soul, that we may open or shut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
at will; the other is a door that stands open
evermore, and reveals to others constantly,
and often very clearly, the tempers, tastes,
and motives of their hearts. Within, as we
may represent, is character, charging the common
reservoir of influence, and through these
twofold gates of the soul pouring itself out on
the world. Out of one it flows at choice, and
whensoever we purpose to do good or evil to
men. Out of the other it flows each moment,
as light from the sun, and propagates itself
in all beholders.</p>

<p>Then if we go to others, that is, to the subjects
of influence, we find every man endowed
with two inlets of impression; the ear and the
understanding for the reception of speech, and
the sympathetic powers, the sensibilities or
affections, for tinder to those sparks of emotion
revealed by looks, tones, manners and general
conduct. And these sympathetic powers, tho
not immediately rational, are yet inlets, open
on all sides, to the understanding and character.
They have a certain wonderful capacity
to receive impressions, and catch the
meaning of signs, and propagate in us whatsoever
falls into their passive molds from others.
The impressions they receive do not come
through verbal propositions, and are never
received into verbal propositions, it may be,
in the mind, and therefore many think nothing
of them. But precisely on this account
are they the more powerful, because it is as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
if one heart were thus going directly into
another, and carrying in its feelings with it.
Beholding, as in a glass, the feelings of our
neighbor, we are changed into the same image,
by the assimilating power of sensibility and
fellow-feeling. Many have gone so far, and
not without show, at least, of reason, as to
maintain that the look or expression, and even
the very features of children, are often
changed by exclusive intercourse with nurses
and attendants. Furthermore, if we carefully
consider, we shall find it scarcely possible to
doubt, that simply to look on bad and malignant
faces, or those whose expressions have
become infected by vice, to be with them and
become familiarized to them, is enough permanently
to affect the character of persons
of mature age. I do not say that it must of
necessity subvert their character, for the evil
looked upon may never be loved or welcomed
in practise; but it is something to have these
bad images in the soul, giving out their expressions
there, and diffusing their odor
among the thoughts, as long as we live. How
dangerous a thing is it, for example, for a
man to become accustomed to sights of cruelty?
What man, valuing the honor of his
soul, would not shrink from yielding himself
to such an influence? No more is it a thing
of indifference to become accustomed to look
on the manners, and receive the bad expression
of any kind of sin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>The door of involuntary communication, I
have said, is always open. Of course we are
communicating ourselves in this way to others
at every moment of our intercourse or presence
with them. But how very seldom, in
comparison, do we undertake by means of
speech to influence others! Even the best
Christian, one who most improves his opportunities
to do good, attempts but seldom to
sway another by voluntary influence, whereas
he is all the while shining as a luminous
object unawares, and communicating of his
heart to the world.</p>

<p>But there is yet another view of this double
line of communication which man has with
his fellow-men, which is more general, and
displays the import of the truth yet more
convincingly. It is by one of these modes of
communication that we are constituted members
of voluntary society, and by the other,
parts of a general mass, or members of involuntary
society. You are all, in a certain
view, individuals, and separate as persons
from each other; you are also, in a
certain other view, parts of a common body,
as truly as the parts of a stone. Thus if you
ask how it is that you and all men came without
your consent to exist in society, to be
within its power, to be under its laws, the
answer is, that while you are a man, you are
also a fractional element of a larger and more
comprehensive being, called society&mdash;be it the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
family, the church, the state. In a certain
department of your nature, it is open; its sympathies
and feelings are open. On this open
side you will adhere together, as parts of a
larger nature, in which there is a common
circulation of want, impulse, and law. Being
thus made common to each other voluntarily,
you become one mass, one consolidated social
body, animated by one life. And observe how
far this involuntary communication and sympathy
between the members of a state or a
family is sovereign over their character. It
always results in what we call the national or
family spirit; for there is a spirit peculiar to
every state and family in the world. Sometimes,
too, this national or family spirit takes
a religious or an irreligious character, and
appears almost to absorb the religious self-government
of individuals. What was the
national spirit of France, for example, at a
certain time, but a spirit of infidelity? What
is the religious spirit of Spain at this moment,
but a spirit of bigotry, quite as wide of Christianity
and destructive of character as the
spirit of falsehood? What is the family spirit
in many a house, but the spirit of gain, or
pleasure, or appetite, in which everything
that is warm, dignified, genial, and good in
religion, is visibly absent? Sometimes you
will almost fancy that you see the shapes of
money in the eyes of children. So it is that
we are led on by nations, as it were, to good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
or bad immortality. Far down in the secret
foundations of life and society there lie concealed
great laws and channels of influence,
which make the race common to each other in
all the main departments or divisions of the
social mass, laws which often escape our notice
altogether, but which are to society as gravity
to the general system of God's works.</p>

<p>But these are general considerations, and
more fit, perhaps, to give you a rational conception
of the modes of influence and their
relative power, than to verify that conception,
or establish its truth. I now proceed to add,
therefore, some miscellaneous proofs of a more
particular nature.</p>

<p>And I mention, first of all, the instinct of
imitation in children. We begin our mortal
experience, not with acts grounded in judgment
or reason, or with ideas received through
language, but by simple imitation, and, under
the guidance of this, we lay our foundations.
The child looks and listens, and whatsoever
tone of feeling or manner of conduct is displayed
around him, sinks into his plastic,
passive soul, and becomes a mold of his being
ever after. The very handling of the nursery
is significant, and the petulance, the passion,
the gentleness, the tranquillity indicated by it,
are all reproduced in the child. His soul is
a purely receptive nature, and that for a
considerable period, without choice or selection.
A little further on he begins voluntarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
to copy everything he sees. Voice,
manner, gait, everything which the eye sees,
the mimic instinct delights to act over. And
thus we have a whole generation of future
men, receiving from us their beginnings, and
the deepest impulses of their life and immortality.
They watch us every moment, in the
family, before the hearth, and at the table;
and when we are meaning them no good or
evil, when we are conscious of exerting no
influence over them, they are drawing from us
impressions and molds of habit, which, if
wrong, no heavenly discipline can wholly remove;
or, if right, no bad associations utterly
dissipate. Now it may be doubted, I think,
whether, in all the active influence of our
lives, we do as much to shape the destiny of our
fellow-men as we do in this single article of
unconscious influence over children.</p>

<p>Still further on, respect for others takes the
place of imitation. We naturally desire the
approbation or good opinion of others. You
see the strength of this feeling in the article
of fashion. How few persons have the nerve
to resist a fashion! We have fashions, too,
in literature, and in worship, and in moral
and religious doctrine, almost equally powerful.
How many will violate the best rules of
society, because it is the practise of the circle!
How many reject Christ because of friends or
acquaintance, who have no suspicion of the
influence they exert, and will not have,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
till the last days show them what they
have done! Every good man has thus
a power in his person, more mighty
than his words and arguments, and which
others feel when he little suspects it. Every
bad man, too, has a fund of poison in his
character, which is tainting those around him,
when it is not in his thoughts to do them
injury. He is read and understood. His
sensual tastes and habits, his unbelieving
spirit, his suppressed leer at religions, have
all a power, and take hold of the heart of
others, whether he will have it so or not.</p>

<p>Again, how well understood is it that the
most active feelings and impulses of mankind
are contagious. How quick enthusiasm of any
sort is to kindle, and how rapidly it catches
from one to another, till a nation blazes in the
flame! In the case of the Crusades you have
an example where the personal enthusiasm
of one man put all the states of Europe in
motion. Fanaticism is almost equally contagious.
Fear and superstition always infect
the mind of the circle in which they are manifested.
The spirit of war generally becomes
an epidemic of madness, when once it has got
possession of a few minds. The spirit of party
is propagated in a similar manner. How any
slight operation in the market may spread,
like a fire, if successful, till trade runs wild
in a general infatuation, is well known. Now,
in all these examples, the effect is produced,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
not by active endeavor to carry influence, but
mostly by that insensible propagation which
follows, when a flame of any kind is once more
kindled.</p>

<p>It is also true, you may ask, that the
religious spirit propagates itself or tends to
propagate itself in the same way? I see no
reason to question that it does. Nor does anything
in the doctrine of spiritual influences,
when rightly understood, forbid the supposition.
For spiritual influences are never separated
from the laws of thought in the individual,
and the laws of feeling and influence
in society. If, too, every disciple is to be an
"epistle known and read of all men," what
shall we expect, but that all men will be somehow
affected by the reading? Or if he is to be
a light in the world, what shall we look for,
but that others, seeing his good works, shall
glorify God on his account? How often is it
seen, too, as a fact of observation, that one
or a few good men kindle at length a holy
fire in the community in which they live, and
become the leaven of general reformation!
Such men give a more vivid proof in their
persons of the reality of religious faith than
any words or arguments could yield. They
are active; they endeavor, of course, to exert
a good voluntary influence; but still their
chief power lies in their holiness and the sense
they produce in others of their close relation
to God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>It now remains to exhibit the very important
fact, that where the direct or active influence
of men is supposed to be great, even this
is due, in a principal degree, to that insensible
influence by which their arguments, reproofs,
and persuasions are secretly invigorating.
It is not mere words which turn men; it is the
heart mounting, uncalled, into the expression
of the features; it is the eye illuminated by
reason, the look beaming with goodness; it is
the tone of the voice, that instrument of the
soul, which changes quality with such amazing
facility, and gives out in the soft, the tender,
the tremulous, the firm, every shade of emotion
and character. And so much is there in
this, that the moral stature and character of
the man that speaks are likely to be well represented
in his manner. If he is a stranger, his
way will inspire confidence and attract good
will. His virtues will be seen, as it were,
gathering round him to minister words and
forms of thought, and their voices will be
heard in the fall of his cadences. And the
same is true of bad men, or men who have
nothing in their character corresponding to
what they attempt to do. If without heart or
interest you attempt to move another, the
involuntary man tells what you are doing in
a hundred ways at once. A hypocrite, endeavoring
to exert a good influence, only tries to
convey by words what the lying look, and the
faithless affectation, or dry exaggeration of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
his manner perpetually resists. We have it
for a fashion to attribute great or even prodigious
results to the voluntary efforts and
labors of men. Whatever they effect is commonly
referred to nothing but the immediate
power of what they do. Let us take an example,
like that of Paul, and analyze it. Paul
was a man of great fervor and enthusiasm.
He combined, withal, more of what is lofty
and morally commanding in his character,
than most of the very distinguished men of
the world. Having this for his natural character,
and his natural character exalted and
made luminous by Christian faith, and the
manifest indwelling of God, he had of course
an almost superhuman sway over others.
Doubtless he was intelligent, strong in argument,
eloquent, active, to the utmost of his
powers, but still he moved the world more by
what he was than by what he did. The
grandeur and spiritual splendor of his character
were ever adding to his active efforts an
element of silent power, which was the real
and chief cause of their efficacy. He convinced,
subdued, inspired, and led, because of the half-divine
authority which appeared in his conduct,
and his glowing spirit. He fought the
good fight, because he kept the faith, and filled
his powerful nature with influences drawn
from higher worlds.</p>

<p>And here I must conduct you to a yet
higher example, even that of the Son of God,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
the light of the world. Men dislike to be
swayed by direct, voluntary influence. They
are jealous of such control, and are therefore
best approached by conduct and feeling, and
the authority of simple worth, which seem to
make no purposed onset. If goodness appears,
they welcome its celestial smile; if
heaven descends to encircle them, they yield
to its sweetness; if truth appears in the life,
they honor it with a secret homage; if personal
majesty and glory appear, they bow
with reverence, and acknowledge with shame
their own vileness. Now it is on this side of
human nature that Christ visits us, preparing
just that kind of influence which the spirit
of truth may wield with the most persuasive
and subduing effect. It is the grandeur of His
character which constitutes the chief power of
His ministry, not His miracles or teachings
apart from His character. Miracles were
useful, at the time, to arrest attention,
and His doctrine is useful at all times
as the highest revelation of truth possible
in speech; but the greatest truth of the
gospel, notwithstanding, is Christ Himself&mdash;a
human body becomes the organ of the
divine nature, and reveals, under the conditions
of an earthly life, the glory of God!
The Scripture writers have much to say, in
this connection, of the image of God; and an
image, you know, is that which simply represents,
not that which acts, or reasons, or persuades.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
Now it is this image of God which
makes the center, the sun itself, of the gospel.
The journeyings, teachings, miracles, and
sufferings of Christ, all had their use in bringing
out this image, or what is the same, in
making conspicuous the character and feelings
of God, both toward sinners and toward sin.
And here is the power of Christ&mdash;it is that
God's beauty, love, truth, and justice shines
through Him. It is the influence which flows
unconsciously and spontaneously out of
Christ, as the friend of man, the light of the
world, the glory of the Father, made visible.
And some have gone so far as to conjecture
that God made the human person, originally,
with a view to its becoming the organ or
vehicle by which He might reveal His communicable
attributes to other worlds. Christ,
they believe, came to inhabit this organ, that
He might execute a purpose so sublime. The
human person is constituted, they say, to be a
mirror of God; and God, being imaged in that
mirror, as in Christ, is held up to the view
of this and other worlds. It certainly is to
the view of this; and if the Divine nature can
use the organ so effectively to express itself
unto us, if it can bring itself, through the
looks, tones, motions, and conduct of a human
person, more close to our sympathies than
by any other means, how can we think
that an organ so communicative, inhabited
by us, is not always breathing our spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
and transferring our image insensibly to
others?</p>

<p>I have protracted the argument on this
subject beyond what I could have wished,
but I can not dismiss it without suggesting
a few thoughts necessary to its complete practical
effect.</p>

<p>One very obvious and serious inference
from it, and the first which I will name, is,
that it is impossible to live in this world and
escape responsibility. It is not that they
alone, as you have seen, who are trying purposely
to convert or corrupt others, who exert
an influence; you can not live without exerting
influence. The doors of your soul are open
on others, and theirs on you. You inhabit a
house which is well-nigh transparent; and
what you are within, you are ever showing
yourself to be without, by signs that have no
ambiguous expression. If you had the seeds
of a pestilence in your body, you would not
have a more active contagion than you have in
your tempers, tastes, and principles. Simply
to be in this world, whatever you are, is to
exert an influence&mdash;an influence, too, compared
with which mere language and persuasion
are feeble. You say that you mean well;
at least, you think you mean to injure no one.
Do you injure no one? Is your example
harmless? Is it ever on the side of God and
duty? You can not reasonably doubt that
others are continually receiving impressions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
from your character. As little you can doubt
that you must answer for these impressions.
If the influence you exert is unconsciously
exerted, then it is only the most sincere, the
truest expression of your character. And for
what can you be held responsible, if not for
this? Do not deceive yourselves in the thought
that you are at least doing no injury, and are,
therefore, living without responsibility; first,
make it sure that you are not every hour infusing
moral death insensibly into your children,
wives, husbands, friends, and acquaintances.
By a mere look or glance, not unlikely, you are
conveying the influence that shall turn the
scale of some one's immortality. Dismiss,
therefore, the thought that you are living
without responsibility; that is impossible.
Better is it frankly to admit the truth; and if
you will risk the influence of a character
unsanctified by duty and religion, prepare to
meet your reckoning manfully, and receive
the just recompense of reward.</p>

<p>The true philosophy or method of doing
good is also here explained. It is, first of all
and principally, to be good&mdash;to have a character
that will of itself communicate good.
There must and will be active effort where
there is goodness of principle; but the latter
we should hold to be the principal thing, the
root and life of all. Whether it is a mistake
more sad or more ridiculous, to make mere
stir synonymous with doing good, we need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
not inquire; enough, to be sure that one who
has taken up such a notion of doing good, is
for that reason a nuisance to the Church. The
Christian is called a light, not lightning. In
order to act with effect on others, he must
walk in the Spirit, and thus become the image
of goodness; he must be so akin to God, and so
filled with His dispositions, that he shall seem
to surround himself with a hallowed atmosphere.
It is folly to endeavor to make ourselves
shine before we are luminous. If the
sun without his beams should talk to the
planets, and argue with them till the final day,
it would not make them shine; there must be
light in the sun itself; and then they will
shine, of course. And this, my brethren, is
what God intends for you all. It is the great
idea of His gospel, and the work of His spirit,
to make you lights in the world. His greatest
joy is to give you character, to beautify your
example, to exalt your principles, and make
you each the depository of His own almighty
grace. But in order to do this, something is
necessary on your part&mdash;a full surrender of
your mind to duty and to God, and a perpetual
desire of this spiritual intimacy; having
this, having a participation thus of the
goodness of God, you will as naturally communicate
good as the sun communicates his
beams.</p>

<p>Our doctrine of unconscious and undesigning
influence shows how it is, also, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
preaching of Christ is often unfruitful, and
especially in times of spiritual coldness. It
is not because truth ceases to be truth, nor, of
necessity, because it is preached in a less vivid
manner, but because there are so many influences
preaching against the preacher. He is
one, the people are many; his attempt to convince
and persuade is a voluntary influence;
their lives, on the other hand, and especially
the lives of those who profess what is better,
are so many unconscious influences ever
streaming forth upon the people, and back
and forth between each other. He preaches
the truth, and they, with one consent, are
preaching the truth down; and how can he
prevail against so many, and by a kind of
influence so unequal? When the people of
God are glowing with spiritual devotion to
Him, and love to men, the case is different;
then they are all preaching with the preacher,
and making an atmosphere of warmth for his
words to fall in; great is the company of them
that publish the truth, and proportionally
great its power. Shall I say more? Have you
not already felt, my brethren, the application
to which I would bring you? We do not exonerate
ourselves; we do not claim to be nearer
to God or holier than you; but, ah! you know
how easy it is to make a winter about us, or
how cold it feels! Our endeavor is to preach
the truth of Christ and His cross as clearly
and as forcefully as we can. Sometimes it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
has a visible effect, and we are filled with joy;
sometimes it has no effect, and then we
struggle on, as we must, but under great
oppression. Have we none among you that
preach against us in your lives? If we show
you the light of God's truth, does it never fall
on banks of ice; which if the light shows
through, the crystal masses are yet as cold
as before? We do not accuse you; that we
leave to God, and to those who may rise up
in the last day to testify against you. If they
shall come out of your own families; if they
are the children that wear your names, the
husband or wife of your affections; if they
declare that you, by your example, kept them
away from Christ's truth and mercy, we may
have accusations to meet of our own, and we
leave you to acquit yourselves as best you
may. I only warn you, here, of the guilt
which our Lord Jesus Christ will impute to
them that hinder His gospel.</p>
